title: 'Lecture 30: Stem Cells/Cloning 2'
transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>Good morning, class. Nice to see you here,</span> <span\
  \ m='4000'>you loyal holdouts, the stalwarts who haven't gone home early for</span>\
  \ <span m='8000'>Thanksgiving. You recall that last time we were talking about the</span>\
  \ <span m='12000'>Matevoidic system, and much of the rationale for</span> <span\
  \ m='16000'>studying it stems from two reasons. First of all, it recapitulates in\
  \ a</span> <span m='20000'>formal sense what happens during embryogenesis,</span>\
  \ <span m='25000'>i.e. one has relatively undifferentiated stem cells which</span>\
  \ <span m='29000'>are able to differentiate into a number of different directions\
  \ by</span> <span m='33000'>committing themselves to either the myeloid or lymphoid\
  \ compartment,</span> <span m='37000'>and then going down yet other pathways, more\
  \ detailed pathways to</span> <span m='41000'>generate a whole variety of cell types.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='46000'>Secondly, we really understand the differentiation pathways\
  \ of</span> <span m='50000'>Matevoisis better than we understand any tissue in the\
  \ body,</span> <span m='54000'>in no small part because it's much easier to study\
  \ the soluble cells in</span> <span m='59000'>the blood and in the immune system\
  \ than it is to study how these</span> <span m='63000'>processes happen in normal\
  \ tissues. But having said that,</span> <span m='68000'>I want to emphasize the\
  \ fact that in each of our tissues there are</span> <span m='73000'>oligopotential\
  \ stem cells. When I say oligopotential I mean</span> <span m='78000'>they can go\
  \ down several different pathways. Recall up there on that</span> <span m='84000'>diagram\
  \ we talked about pluripotential which means multiple,</span> <span m='89000'>and\
  \ today we're going to talk a bit about todipotential stem cells,</span> <span m='94000'>which\
  \ are able to disperse descendants into all the different</span> <span m='99000'>differentiation\
  \ lineages in the body.</span> </p><p><span m='105000'>At the end of our last lecture,\
  \ we were focusing on the red blood</span> <span m='110000'>cells. And this is sometimes\
  \ called erythropoiesis,</span> <span m='116000'>which is to say the process by\
  \ which red blood cells are generated.</span> </p><p><span m='122000'>We mentioned\
  \ the concept of homeostasis, and homeostasis just</span> <span m='126000'>refers\
  \ to the fact that all of these systems are in very delicate balance</span> <span\
  \ m='131000'>so that the body can respond to the physiologic needs of the organism\
  \ at</span> <span m='135000'>any one point in time. We talked about the fact that\
  \ for</span> <span m='140000'>example when there's a massive infection in the body,</span>\
  \ <span m='144000'>then the homeostatic mechanisms allow an increase in these kinds\
  \ of</span> <span m='149000'>immune cells in order to encounter the infection.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='154000'>And at the end of our last lecture, we were talking about\
  \ this specific</span> <span m='158000'>branch, and how in fact homeostasis is maintained\
  \ there.</span> </p><p><span m='163000'>And what we see here is a series of committed\
  \ progenitors.</span> </p><p><span m='168000'>So when I talk about committed progenitors\
  \ I'm referring to cells</span> <span m='172000'>that have already made the commitment\
  \ to go down one</span> <span m='177000'>or another pathway. They're not yet fully\
  \ differentiated.</span> </p><p><span m='182000'>As you can see here, we have first\
  \ forming cells and</span> <span m='186000'>colony forming cells. We don't need\
  \ to remember all the</span> <span m='190000'>different abbreviations except to\
  \ say that these cells here are in a</span> <span m='194000'>relative undifferentiated\
  \ state. And the only end stage</span> <span m='198000'>differentiation comes at\
  \ the very end here when we get to red blood</span> <span m='202000'>cells. We said\
  \ in general that it's the case that most highly</span> <span m='206000'>differentiated\
  \ cells are post-mitotic, which is to say</span> <span m='210000'>they're never\
  \ going to reenter into the growth and division cycle of the</span> <span m='214000'>cell\
  \ that we talked about earlier in the semester.</span> </p><p><span m='218000'>And\
  \ that's obviously dictated here by the fact that this erythrocyte</span> <span\
  \ m='222000'>lacks a nucleus, i.e. during the final stage of</span> <span m='226000'>differentiation,\
  \ in addition to accumulating large</span> <span m='230000'>amounts of hemoglobin\
  \ in its cytoplasm, this cell actually pops</span> <span m='234000'>out its nucleus,\
  \ and that obviously represents an</span> <span m='238000'>irrevocable change in\
  \ that cell can never again enter into growth</span> <span m='242000'>and division\
  \ cycle. The immediate precursor of an</span> <span m='246000'>erythrocyte is often\
  \ called an erythroblast. And the term blast</span> <span m='252000'>here refers\
  \ to a cell of embryonic appearance. Blast is used often to</span> <span m='257000'>indicate,\
  \ we'll mention that again shortly, a cell which looks very</span> <span m='263000'>primitive,\
  \ and embryonic, and undifferentiated. And that ends</span> <span m='268000'>up\
  \ going into an erythrocyte, which we said is actually a synonym</span> <span m='274000'>for\
  \ a red blood cell, an RBC, a red blood cell.</span> </p><p><span m='280000'>And\
  \ we talked about the fact that this progression is actually</span> <span m='284000'>maintained\
  \ and furthered by the stimulus of the compound called</span> <span m='289000'>erythropoietin.\
  \ So, we're using some of the same</span> <span m='293000'>words over and over again.\
  \ And erythropoietin is essentially a</span> <span m='298000'>growth factor which\
  \ stimulates the end stage differentiation of the</span> <span m='303000'>erythroblast\
  \ into the erythrocyte.</span> </p><p><span m='308000'>Epo, as erythropoietin's\
  \ often abbreviated, is actually made in the</span> <span m='313000'>kidneys. And\
  \ it's made in the kidneys in response to the</span> <span m='319000'>physiological\
  \ stimulus of hypoxia. Hypoxia means inadequate</span> <span m='325000'>oxygenation\
  \ of the tissues. You might ask, well, why is red</span> <span m='331000'>blood\
  \ cell contractions controlled, as they are, in the kidney?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='337000'>And the fact is, we don't really know why evolution</span> <span m='341000'>has\
  \ chosen the kidney as the site of monitoring the degree of oxygenation</span> <span\
  \ m='345000'>of the blood. And in response to hypoxia, it begins to crank out</span>\
  \ <span m='349000'>erythropoietin, or Epo. You can think of</span> <span m='353000'>erythropoietin\
  \ as an extracellular liggon just like a growth factor.</span> </p><p><span m='357000'>It\
  \ has its own cognate receptor on the surface of the erythroblast,</span> <span\
  \ m='361000'>and when Epo released by the kidney hits an erythroblast in the context</span>\
  \ <span m='366000'>of the bone marrow, it actually has two effects.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='371000'>It happens to be the case that roughly even 95% of the erythroblast</span>\
  \ <span m='376000'>that are made routinely are forced to go into apitosis under\
  \ routine</span> <span m='381000'>conditions. So, this is an enormously wasteful</span>\
  \ <span m='386000'>system, i.e. as every moment we speak, 90 or 95% of the erythroblast</span>\
  \ <span m='391000'>that have come into existence in your bone marrow apitose.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='397000'>They never go into end stage differentiation.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='403000'>But when Epo is around, Epo provides a strong anti-apoptotic</span>\
  \ <span m='410000'>signal to the red blood saves some and maybe even all of the</span>\
  \ <span m='416000'>erythroblasts from their normal fate of undergoing apitosis.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='423000'>So here, if we imagine there are actually two fates,</span>\
  \ <span m='427000'>one is to become an erythrocyte, and the other is to apitose,\
  \ where</span> <span m='432000'>the aptisosis is paradoxically enough the dominant\
  \ fate of the cell,</span> <span m='436000'>the moment that an Epo comes on the\
  \ scene, it blocks this alternative</span> <span m='441000'>fate, allowing these\
  \ cells to mature. Epo at the same time stimulates the</span> <span m='445000'>erythroblast\
  \ to differentiate. Now, you might as yourself the</span> <span m='450000'>question,\
  \ why is there this enormously inefficient process?</span> </p><p><span m='455000'>An\
  \ enormous effort is made to crank out large, astronomical numbers of</span> <span\
  \ m='458000'>erythroblasts, and yet most of them are wasted even</span> <span m='462000'>before\
  \ they've had a chance to undergo end stage differentiation.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='466000'>And the rationale here is as follows. This is a terrific system</span>\
  \ <span m='470000'>for rapidly ramping up the level of red blood cells in your circulation</span>\
  \ <span m='474000'>because here, within a matter of a day or two, one can crank\
  \ up,</span> <span m='478000'>actually in a matter of hours, you can crank up the\
  \ rate of</span> <span m='482000'>production of red blood cells by maybe even a\
  \ factor of ten.</span> </p><p><span m='486000'>Instead of having 90% of the erythroblast\
  \ apitose,</span> <span m='490000'>let's say 0% of them do so, and therefore, instead\
  \ of having 10%</span> <span m='494000'>of the erythroblasts becoming red blood\
  \ cells, 100% of them will do so.</span> </p><p><span m='498000'>And therefore,\
  \ you have the virtually miraculous</span> <span m='502000'>response that if you\
  \ go from here high up in the rocky mountains at</span> <span m='506000'>ten or\
  \ 12,000 feet, within a matter of two or three days,</span> <span m='510000'>your\
  \ red blood cell concentration actually has compensated,</span> <span m='514000'>has\
  \ risen up to create the oxygen caring capacity that enables you to</span> <span\
  \ m='518000'>deal with the thin oxygen, with the low oxygen tension that's</span>\
  \ <span m='522000'>present at high altitudes. Now, having said that,</span> <span\
  \ m='527000'>the fact is that there is an Epo receptor on the surface of the</span>\
  \ <span m='532000'>erythroblast, and what we see there is the following.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='538000'>Let's talk about the erythroblast and just blow it up\
  \ a little bit.</span> </p><p><span m='541000'>So, here's the erythroblast. That's\
  \ the undifferentiated</span> <span m='545000'>precursor. And by the way, the erythroblast\
  \ is actually still a</span> <span m='548000'>white blood cell. Often we call a\
  \ white blood cell a</span> <span m='552000'>leukocyte. You may know that gluco\
  \ means white. So,</span> <span m='555000'>a leukocyte, it's still white. And after\
  \ the erythropotent</span> <span m='559000'>impinges on it, one of the things it\
  \ starts doing is</span> <span m='562000'>to make the hemoglobin, which turns it\
  \ into a red blood cell.</span> </p><p><span m='566000'>At this stage, it's still\
  \ white. On the surface of the erythroblast</span> <span m='570000'>are these Epo\
  \ receptors. I'll just abbreviate them like this,</span> <span m='575000'>Epo receptor,\
  \ and once it binds the liggon Epo just like the growth</span> <span m='580000'>factor\
  \ receptors, we talked early in the receptors</span> <span m='585000'>signals are\
  \ sent into the erythroblast to stimulate both</span> <span m='589000'>differentiation\
  \ and to prevent the initiation of the cell suicide</span> <span m='594000'>program\
  \ that we call apitosis. Interestingly, one of the things</span> <span m='599000'>that\
  \ happens normally is the following, that when these signals</span> <span m='604000'>come\
  \ in, there is an enzyme called a phosphotase which is attracted</span> <span m='609000'>to\
  \ the receptor. The Epo receptor works like a</span> <span m='614000'>tyrosine kinase\
  \ growth factor receptor that we talked about</span> <span m='618000'>earlier in\
  \ the semester. And here, we have an enzyme,</span> <span m='622000'>a phosphotase,\
  \ which actually counteracts the function of the</span> <span m='627000'>tyrosine\
  \ kinases. So, after the Epo receptor has</span> <span m='631000'>bound its liggon,\
  \ here's the plasma membrane,</span> <span m='635000'>it has a whole series of I'll\
  \ draw Y here for tyrosine.</span> </p><p><span m='640000'>It has a whole series\
  \ of phosphates attached to it because of the</span> <span m='643000'>actions of\
  \ tyrosine kinase enzymes that are associated with its</span> <span m='647000'>cytoplasmic\
  \ domain indirect analogy to what we talked about in the case</span> <span m='651000'>of\
  \ growth factor receptors. But, one of the things that happens</span> <span m='654000'>is\
  \ that this phosphotase, which removes phosphates, then gloms</span> <span m='658000'>onto\
  \ the receptor like this. It grabs hold of some of these</span> <span m='662000'>tyrosine\
  \ kinases. And what this phosphotase does is</span> <span m='666000'>reach around.\
  \ It reaches around and it begins to prune off all of these</span> <span m='670000'>phosphates\
  \ because that's what a phosphate does.</span> </p><p><span m='674000'>It cuts away\
  \ all the phosphates, thereby directly reversing the</span> <span m='679000'>previous\
  \ actions of the tyrosine kinase that led to the formation of</span> <span m='683000'>these\
  \ phosphates, and that in turn allows downstream</span> <span m='687000'>signaling\
  \ to occur. This is obviously a functional</span> <span m='692000'>negative feedback\
  \ loop, i.e. whenever there is an agonist</span> <span m='696000'>you want an antagonist.\
  \ Whenever there's a stimulus which</span> <span m='700000'>is induced in the body,\
  \ there has to be an inhibitory signal,</span> <span m='704000'>and this is part\
  \ of the whole issue of homeostasis,</span> <span m='708000'>the balance between\
  \ forward and backward. Interestingly enough,</span> <span m='712000'>there's a\
  \ family in Finland, I believe, which has a mutant receptor.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='716000'>And their mutant receptor lacks this tyrosine.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='721000'>And what happens as a consequence is that that particular tyrosine</span>\
  \ <span m='724000'>doesn't get phosphorolated. Because that tyrosine doesn't get</span>\
  \ <span m='727000'>phosphorolated, the phosphotase cannot be attracted</span> <span\
  \ m='731000'>to the receptor because there isn't a tyrosine there.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='734000'>There's some other amino acid residue. I don't know what it is.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='738000'>It's not important, but it's not a tyrosine. And this\
  \ cannot happen</span> <span m='741000'>because they don't have this tyrosine. This\
  \ phosphotase could</span> <span m='744000'>not be attracted to the receptor to\
  \ shut it down as it normally</span> <span m='748000'>would be. So normally homeostasis\
  \ is</span> <span m='752000'>imbalanced, and several members of this family have\
  \ become Olympic</span> <span m='756000'>cross-country ski winners. They've become\
  \ Olympic champions.</span> </p><p><span m='761000'>Why? Because their Epo receptor's\
  \ hyperactive. Because the Epo</span> <span m='765000'>receptor's hyperactive, they\
  \ have higher than normal levels</span> <span m='769000'>of red blood cells in the\
  \ circulation, and this clearly allows</span> <span m='774000'>them to function\
  \ better in cross country skiing,</span> <span m='778000'>which as you know is a\
  \ really physically demanding task.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>Again, I'm not\
  \ saying this is a good thing for them necessarily.</span> </p><p><span m='786000'>There\
  \ are other things in life besides, believe it or not,</span> <span m='790000'>winning\
  \ cross country Olympic competitions because as I mentioned</span> <span m='794000'>last\
  \ time, having too many red blood cells in your circulation,</span> <span m='798000'>there's\
  \ a downside to it which is that you have a much greater</span> <span m='802000'>tendency\
  \ to have occlusions, to have blood clots in your</span> <span m='806000'>circulation\
  \ which obviously is not a very good thing to have.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>Oh,\
  \ so is there a threshold of Epo</span> <span m='818000'>receptor activation before\
  \ phosphotase shuts it down?</span> </p><p><span m='821000'>These things are not\
  \ really well understood, are not well studied.</span> </p><p><span m='824000'>The\
  \ fact is, you might be able to say we should make a mathematical</span> <span m='827000'>model\
  \ of all of these different circuitry. But the fact is if you</span> <span m='831000'>want\
  \ to make a mathematical model, you have to know some of the</span> <span m='834000'>constants.\
  \ You have to know some of the parameters, the binding</span> <span m='837000'>constants.\
  \ And in fact, for most of the</span> <span m='840000'>signaling interactions, no\
  \ one's ever really studied them in</span> <span m='844000'>such great detail. So,\
  \ one really doesn't know how</span> <span m='848000'>much phosphate you need here\
  \ before the phosphotase becomes really</span> <span m='851000'>active. And so,\
  \ there's not a really good</span> <span m='855000'>mathematical model of this feedback\
  \ loop, even though we know without</span> <span m='859000'>any doubt that it exists.\
  \ So, I want to get into other issues</span> <span m='862000'>that are related to\
  \ the whole issue of accumulated differentiation</span> <span m='866000'>traits\
  \ as one moves down this pathway.</span> </p><p><span m='870000'>Again, we've used\
  \ this as a model for how differentiation takes place</span> <span m='874000'>in\
  \ the entire body. The faith that's been implicit in</span> <span m='878000'>this\
  \ kind of scheme for the last 20 or 30 years is that this acquisition</span> <span\
  \ m='882000'>of different kinds of phenotypes is not accompanied by genetic changes,</span>\
  \ <span m='887000'>that is, in the genomes of these cells. I.e. one can accomplish</span>\
  \ <span m='891000'>these different kinds of differentiation not by rearranging</span>\
  \ <span m='895000'>genes but just by rearranging transcriptional programs,</span>\
  \ <span m='900000'>and that the DNA sequence of these cells as they proliferate\
  \ and</span> <span m='903000'>differentiate is fully unchanged. And that's a matter\
  \ of faith</span> <span m='907000'>because you could say to me, how do you know\
  \ that it's really</span> <span m='911000'>true. The fact is that people have looked\
  \ at genes in many kinds of</span> <span m='915000'>cell types, but it's essentially\
  \ impossible, or it has been at least</span> <span m='918000'>until recently, to\
  \ preclude the possibility that as</span> <span m='922000'>cells move down these\
  \ differentiation pathways,</span> <span m='926000'>they begin to change the nucleotide\
  \ sequences of different</span> <span m='930000'>ones of their genes. In fact, I've\
  \ already told you about</span> <span m='933000'>one instance where that's clearly\
  \ the case. And that is in the</span> <span m='937000'>differentiation of the B\
  \ cells of the immune system,</span> <span m='941000'>which happen to be right up\
  \ here on this chart, because as you recall</span> <span m='945000'>from our discussion\
  \ vis-\xE0-vis immunology, the B cells actually do</span> <span m='948000'>rearrange\
  \ their genes in order to cobble together DNA sequences that</span> <span m='952000'>together\
  \ are able to enable them to make antibodies that are able to</span> <span m='956000'>react\
  \ to specific antigens. So there, there's no doubt at all</span> <span m='960000'>that\
  \ there's a somatic rearrangement of the genes, somatic meaning it's</span> <span\
  \ m='964000'>not a germ line change. It's happening in the soma outside</span> <span\
  \ m='968000'>of the germ line. There's a somatic mutation.</span> </p><p><span m='972000'>It's\
  \ not a mutation that's deleterious, but rather is directed</span> <span m='976000'>towards\
  \ a physiologically normal and desirable end point.</span> </p><p><span m='980000'>But\
  \ for example, how do you know that when you remember things in the</span> <span\
  \ m='984000'>brain, part of the memory does not derive from changing the DNA</span>\
  \ <span m='988000'>sequence and different neurons in the brain?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='992000'>What's the molecular basis of memory? Could it be that each time we\
  \ learn</span> <span m='996000'>some things that there are different nucleotide\
  \ sequences,</span> <span m='1001000'>critical nucleotide sequences, that are changed\
  \ in neurons in the</span> <span m='1005000'>brain, and that those nucleotide sequence\
  \ changes represent an</span> <span m='1010000'>important basis for ensuring that\
  \ memory is retained over decades of</span> <span m='1014000'>time. Or, rather than\
  \ having genetic changes in the brain,</span> <span m='1019000'>might it all be\
  \ epigenetic, i. . all the other changes that happen</span> <span m='1023000'>to\
  \ the cell besides changing DNA sequences in the chromosomal DNA.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1028000'>So, here we're dealing with the dialectic between epigenetic and</span>\
  \ <span m='1033000'>genetic. And, have we talked about DNA methylation</span> <span\
  \ m='1039000'>here? Yes, so we talked about DNA methylation, and do you recall or</span>\
  \ <span m='1044000'>having discussed the fact that when DNA gets methylated,</span>\
  \ <span m='1050000'>that suppresses the transcription of a gene.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1056000'>But that doesn't change the nucleotide sequence,</span> <span m='1059000'>and\
  \ that methylation configuration of a gene can be passed to one cell</span> <span\
  \ m='1063000'>generation to the next. It's heritable, but it's not</span> <span\
  \ m='1066000'>genetic in the strictest sense of the term, i.e.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1070000'>it doesn't involve a change in nucleotide sequence,</span> <span m='1074000'>which\
  \ is what we want to limit this term to referring.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>So,\
  \ epigenic can represent all the changes in the cell including DNA</span> <span\
  \ m='1082000'>methylation, alterations in transcription,</span> <span m='1087000'>and\
  \ all other downstream events that result in changes in the cell.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1092000'>And how can one address this? Well, there are different ways of</span>\
  \ <span m='1097000'>addressing this question or addressing the possibility that\
  \ in</span> <span m='1102000'>fact there are changes in the nucleotide sequence\
  \ of the gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1107000'>One way to do this is the following.\
  \ And that is to take cells from an</span> <span m='1112000'>early embryo, and here\
  \ we see an early vertebrate embryo.</span> </p><p><span m='1117000'>This looks\
  \ really more like a frog embryo or a slightly different shape,</span> <span m='1122000'>and\
  \ here we see an early embryo. It's after a blastula. It's called</span> <span m='1127000'>a\
  \ blastocyst. Here again we have the word blast.</span> </p><p><span m='1132000'>How\
  \ about one question per lecture? We have to have some equity here.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1137000'>Other people can ask questions. It's good to ask questions,</span>\
  \ <span m='1142000'>but how about one per lecture; that's fair, equitable.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1146000'>All right, so here's an early vertebrate embryo.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1150000'>Here we see the blastocyst. This comes after the earlier\
  \ stages</span> <span m='1154000'>in the embryo, and here we see the inner cell\
  \ mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1158000'>And as it turns out, the inner cell mass\
  \ is going to be the precursor of</span> <span m='1162000'>many of the tissues of\
  \ the ultimately arising embryo.</span> </p><p><span m='1166000'>And here, one can\
  \ do an interesting experiment. One can take cells out</span> <span m='1170000'>of\
  \ the inner cell mass. And one can begin to propagate them</span> <span m='1174000'>in\
  \ culture. And what one ends up with is embryonic stem cells.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1178000'>And the intrinsic interest of embryonic stem cells is manifold.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1182000'>For one thing, you can take embryonic stem cells and\
  \ you can</span> <span m='1186000'>genetically alter them. You can put a new gene\
  \ in,</span> <span m='1191000'>in the case of a mouse, or you can take another gene\
  \ out.</span> </p><p><span m='1195000'>And then what you can do is you can inject\
  \ the genetically altered</span> <span m='1199000'>embryonic stem cell into the\
  \ blastocyst of another embryo.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>So let's say we\
  \ take the cells out of the inner cell mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1208000'>We\
  \ develop embryonic stem cells. We can call them ES cells. That's</span> <span m='1213000'>what\
  \ they're called in the trade, ES cells. We take them out. We can</span> <span m='1217000'>propagate\
  \ them in culture. And then, what we can find is we'll</span> <span m='1222000'>put\
  \ a genetic marker in those ES cells. Let's say we put in those</span> <span m='1226000'>embryonic\
  \ stem cells the marker for the gene beta-galactosidase.</span> </p><p><span m='1231000'>And\
  \ beta-galactosidase in the presence of a proper indicator,</span> <span m='1235000'>if\
  \ you put a proper indicator and make a cell turn blue.</span> </p><p><span m='1239000'>So\
  \ now we have an ES cell line that produces the beta-galactosidase</span> <span\
  \ m='1243000'>enzyme. The beta-galactosidase enzyme beta-gal itself has no effect</span>\
  \ <span m='1247000'>on the biology of the cells. It's only a marker. And now,</span>\
  \ <span m='1251000'>we take those ES cells, and we inject them into another embryo,</span>\
  \ <span m='1255000'>a wild type embryo that lacks this beta-gal marker.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1260000'>And what we can see is that we inject the ES cells into this</span>\
  \ <span m='1265000'>blastocyst. The injected ES cells will now insinuate themselves,</span>\
  \ <span m='1270000'>will now intrude into the massive cells in this embryo into\
  \ which we</span> <span m='1275000'>injected the ES cells, and they will become\
  \ part of the</span> <span m='1280000'>entire embryo genesis that follows. I.e.\
  \ soon these foreign ES cells</span> <span m='1285000'>will weasel their way into\
  \ this inner cell mass.</span> </p><p><span m='1290000'>And they will become established\
  \ and become functionally equivalent to</span> <span m='1294000'>the inner cell\
  \ mass cells that were resident there prior to this</span> <span m='1298000'>injection.\
  \ And what you can do then is follow the subsequent fate of,</span> <span m='1302000'>in\
  \ this case, a mouse. And what will happen often is that you can</span> <span m='1306000'>find\
  \ blue cells all over the mouse sometimes in the paws,</span> <span m='1310000'>sometimes\
  \ in the coat. Let's imagine that the hair would turn</span> <span m='1314000'>blue,\
  \ which in fact is not the case. But let's imagine the hair would</span> <span m='1318000'>turn\
  \ blue. So here's the mouse,</span> <span m='1322000'>happy because it's part of\
  \ an important experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>And what you'll sometimes\
  \ see is that, well, remember that art was</span> <span m='1331000'>not my forte.\
  \ Anyhow, here you might see stripes of blue</span> <span m='1336000'>cells on the\
  \ skin. The hair won't turn blue actually,</span> <span m='1340000'>but the skin\
  \ may if you give it the proper indicator.</span> </p><p><span m='1345000'>And what\
  \ this indicates is that in this case, the cells that were</span> <span m='1349000'>injected\
  \ into the blastocyst could become part of lineages which</span> <span m='1354000'>committed\
  \ themselves to becoming skin cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1359000'>Or, the cells\
  \ in the brain might be blue. Or, the cells in the gut</span> <span m='1363000'>might\
  \ be blue. Or under certain conditions,</span> <span m='1367000'>the cells in the\
  \ intestine might be blue. In telling you that,</span> <span m='1371000'>I mean\
  \ to indicate that the cells that we injected into this</span> <span m='1375000'>blastocyst,\
  \ which carry beta-gal were totipotent.</span> </p><p><span m='1380000'>They could\
  \ create all the tissues of the mouse under the proper</span> <span m='1384000'>conditions.\
  \ The proper conditions are obviously being put into this</span> <span m='1388000'>very\
  \ special environment in which all kinds of differentiation</span> <span m='1392000'>inducing\
  \ signals, which we don't really understand,</span> <span m='1396000'>can induce\
  \ this cell to commit itself to enter into one or another</span> <span m='1400000'>differentiation\
  \ lineage. And in principal, you can make a</span> <span m='1404000'>whole organism\
  \ out of an ES cell. ES cell has as much plasticity, as</span> <span m='1408000'>much\
  \ flexibility, as a fertilized egg.</span> </p><p><span m='1412000'>It has not yet\
  \ lost the ability to make all the parts of the body.</span> </p><p><span m='1416000'>On\
  \ some occasions, the ES cell will even get into the gonads of the</span> <span\
  \ m='1420000'>mouse, which are down here somewhere. And if that's so,</span> <span\
  \ m='1425000'>if the ES cell which you injected has been able to seed the formation</span>\
  \ <span m='1429000'>of these cells down here, then what will happen is that either</span>\
  \ <span m='1434000'>the sperm or the egg coming from this mouse will now transmit</span>\
  \ <span m='1438000'>the blue gene. And now, in the next generation,</span> <span\
  \ m='1444000'>all of the mice will inherit the blue beta-galactosidase gene in all</span>\
  \ <span m='1450000'>of their cells because now this will have entered into the germ\
  \ line.</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>If these blue cells happen to colonize the\
  \ testes,</span> <span m='1462000'>the ovary, or the testes, then these blue cells\
  \ will become</span> <span m='1468000'>ancestors to the sperm or the egg. And now,\
  \ in the next generation,</span> <span m='1472000'>mice will inherit a blue gene\
  \ in all of their cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1476000'>And now this mouse is really\
  \ happy because it's now part of an</span> <span m='1480000'>extremely important\
  \ experiment because now all of its cells will</span> <span m='1484000'>become blue,\
  \ having inherited them as part of the oocyte which led to</span> <span m='1487000'>its\
  \ formation. In this kind of an animal,</span> <span m='1491000'>we call this animal\
  \ a kind of a chimera. Chimera is a mythical</span> <span m='1495000'>beast which\
  \ is, let's say, half human and half horse</span> <span m='1499000'>or something\
  \ like that. Or a chimera means it has</span> <span m='1502000'>genetically different\
  \ parts in it. That is not to say that these parts</span> <span m='1506000'>carrying\
  \ the blue gene are necessarily defective,</span> <span m='1509000'>they're just\
  \ genetically different, one from the other. But they can</span> <span m='1513000'>participate\
  \ in embryogenesis in a fashion that's indistinguishable</span> <span m='1516000'>from\
  \ the non-blue cells. They just do everything they're</span> <span m='1520000'>supposed\
  \ to do, and they pretend as if they were in</span> <span m='1523000'>this embryo\
  \ from the get go, from the very beginning, from the</span> <span m='1527000'>moment\
  \ of fertilization. So they are totipotent.</span> </p><p><span m='1531000'>There's\
  \ an alternative experiment you can do, and you can take the ES</span> <span m='1534000'>cells,\
  \ and you can inject them under the skin of a mouse,</span> <span m='1538000'>let's\
  \ say. So now, you're putting them in a very unfamiliar</span> <span m='1541000'>environment.\
  \ And what you see then on many occasions is you can</span> <span m='1545000'>actually\
  \ get a tumor. You can get what's called an</span> <span m='1549000'>embryonal carcinoma.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1560000'>Now you'll say, well, so what? That's not so</span> <span\
  \ m='1563000'>interesting. But it's very interesting. Why?</span> </p><p><span m='1567000'>Because\
  \ if you look at the genome of those embryonal carcinoma cells</span> <span m='1570000'>which\
  \ we can call EC cells if you want, those cells are genetically</span> <span m='1574000'>full\
  \ wild type. And yet, we're getting a tumor here.</span> </p><p><span m='1577000'>So,\
  \ it means that these cells, which have been placed in a fully</span> <span m='1581000'>unfamiliar\
  \ environment under the skin or in the belly of a mouse will</span> <span m='1584000'>begin\
  \ to form a tumor. And in fact, they represent the</span> <span m='1588000'>only\
  \ type of cell that we know about where a cell having a wild type</span> <span m='1591000'>genome\
  \ can actually give you a tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='1595000'>As you sensed from\
  \ our previous discussions, all other kinds of</span> <span m='1599000'>human cancer\
  \ cells we know about have to have mutant genes in order</span> <span m='1604000'>for\
  \ them to grow as a malignancy. These cells are fully wild type and</span> <span\
  \ m='1608000'>can grow as an embryonal carcinoma. They are very primitive. These</span>\
  \ <span m='1613000'>cells have quite a bit of autonomy. They're not so responsive\
  \ to all</span> <span m='1617000'>the growth factors that normally are required\
  \ by many cells throughout</span> <span m='1622000'>the soma of an animal throughout\
  \ the tissues.</span> </p><p><span m='1627000'>So this allows us to begin to move\
  \ on and ask other kinds of questions.</span> </p><p><span m='1630000'>For example,\
  \ you can take these embryonal carcinoma cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1634000'>You\
  \ put them in a Petri dish, and you can actually induce them to</span> <span m='1638000'>differentiate\
  \ into different cell types in vitro.</span> </p><p><span m='1642000'>How can you\
  \ do that? Well, we're just beginning to learn</span> <span m='1646000'>how to do\
  \ that. We don't really know how to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>But,\
  \ if you give them the right cocktail of growth factors,</span> <span m='1654000'>they\
  \ might begin to form muscle cells. If you give them another</span> <span m='1658000'>cocktail\
  \ of growth factors, they might begin to give pancreatic</span> <span m='1663000'>eyelid\
  \ cells that form insulin, or in this case cartilage cells.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1667000'>And presumably, the cocktail of growth factors you're providing each</span>\
  \ <span m='1672000'>one of these cells with in vitro, i.e. in the Petri dish, is\
  \ mimicking</span> <span m='1676000'>the growth factor environment that each of\
  \ these cell types is</span> <span m='1680000'>experiencing within the embryo. In\
  \ other words,</span> <span m='1684000'>cells in different parts of the embryo experience\
  \ different</span> <span m='1688000'>combinations of growth factors that persuade\
  \ them to commit themselves</span> <span m='1692000'>to becoming these kind of cells,\
  \ these kind of cells, and these kind</span> <span m='1696000'>of cells. And therefore,\
  \ one of the promises of embryonic</span> <span m='1700000'>stem cell research is\
  \ the possibility of being able to</span> <span m='1704000'>regenerate different\
  \ kinds of tissues in a fashion that I just</span> <span m='1708000'>showed you\
  \ here. But this whole experiment in the</span> <span m='1712000'>case of human\
  \ beings is ethically extremely controversial.</span> </p><p><span m='1716000'>Why?\
  \ Because the experiment starts out making these ES cells here,</span> <span m='1720000'>and\
  \ if we want to start out with an early embryo like this,</span> <span m='1724000'>start\
  \ out with a blastocyst, in the case of a human blastocyst,</span> <span m='1728000'>this\
  \ human blastocyst has the potential under the proper</span> <span m='1732000'>conditions\
  \ of becoming a newborn human being. And therefore,</span> <span m='1736000'>we\
  \ have this enormous ethical conflict in this country.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>Is\
  \ this blastocyst already a human being? Can you already afford to</span> <span\
  \ m='1744000'>truncate the life of this blastocyst at this stage of development,</span>\
  \ <span m='1748000'>and in so doing, are you actually extinguishing human life,</span>\
  \ <span m='1753000'>or is this organism, if you want to call it that, already still\
  \ much too</span> <span m='1757000'>primitive to consider it to be equal to human\
  \ life?</span> </p><p><span m='1762000'>And here, I would not, unlike my political\
  \ views,</span> <span m='1766000'>be forward enough to venture an opinion because\
  \ it's really</span> <span m='1771000'>something that no one really can argue about\
  \ in any objective way.</span> </p><p><span m='1775000'>It's all a matter of opinion.\
  \ Is this a human being already,</span> <span m='1780000'>or is it simply an inanimate\
  \ cluster, a clump of cells?</span> </p><p><span m='1784000'>Now, in principal,\
  \ how could we do this?</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>How could we actually create\
  \ this kind of tissue therapy?</span> </p><p><span m='1792000'>Because the fact\
  \ is, as you get older, your tissues start falling</span> <span m='1796000'>apart.\
  \ You haven't experienced that.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>But I have. And\
  \ the fact is that even if you try to stay in shape,</span> <span m='1804000'>things\
  \ just start falling apart. And the older you get,</span> <span m='1809000'>the\
  \ more they fall apart. Even people who eat well,</span> <span m='1813000'>which\
  \ I do, and exercise well, which I don't, even they fall apart.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1818000'>And so the question is, are there way of replacing and repairing</span>\
  \ <span m='1822000'>tissue? And this would, in principal, represent one such</span>\
  \ <span m='1827000'>strategy because it means that you could possibly inject replacement</span>\
  \ <span m='1831000'>cells into an agent tissue and generate cells which could then</span>\
  \ <span m='1836000'>restore and regeneration function which has somehow inevitably</span>\
  \ <span m='1840000'>deteriorated over the decades. Well, that raises the question\
  \ of</span> <span m='1845000'>how you can actually get a blastocyst, how you can\
  \ make a</span> <span m='1850000'>blastocyst like this. To state an obvious thing\
  \ which you</span> <span m='1856000'>might already have intuited, let's say you\
  \ had such cells</span> <span m='1861000'>differentiated from various cell types\
  \ that you want to inject into</span> <span m='1865000'>somebody's muscle or into\
  \ their liver if they had diabetes and had</span> <span m='1869000'>lost their beta\
  \ cells, or into their cartilage if they</span> <span m='1873000'>banged up their\
  \ knee during basketball practice or something</span> <span m='1877000'>like that,\
  \ or jogging, which is allegedly good for you.</span> </p><p><span m='1881000'>Who\
  \ knows? How could you deal with that? Well, the fact is,</span> <span m='1885000'>let's\
  \ imagine there were such a blastocyst which we'd produce in</span> <span m='1889000'>this\
  \ fashion that we differentiated like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1894000'>OK,\
  \ this is now the sequence of events. There's an important</span> <span m='1897000'>consideration\
  \ we have to take into account, and that is if this</span> <span m='1900000'>blastocyst\
  \ came from a different person than you,</span> <span m='1904000'>and we induced\
  \ these cells to differentiate,</span> <span m='1907000'>and we injected those differentiation\
  \ cells into your</span> <span m='1911000'>muscle, things wouldn't work. Why? Because\
  \ these cells, if the</span> <span m='1914000'>blastocyst originated in a different\
  \ person than yourself would be</span> <span m='1917000'>genetically different from\
  \ you, and would be recognized as foreign</span> <span m='1921000'>tissue by your\
  \ immune system. So even though you were getting an</span> <span m='1924000'>injection\
  \ of cells which could regenerate your muscle perfectly</span> <span m='1928000'>well,\
  \ those cells would never be given a chance to establish</span> <span m='1931000'>themselves\
  \ and to thrive, and to reconstruct the tissue simple</span> <span m='1935000'>because\
  \ the immune system would regard those cells as being</span> <span m='1938000'>foreigners\
  \ and would go after them hammer and tongs trying to get rid</span> <span m='1942000'>of\
  \ them in the same way it tries to get rid of all kinds of foreign</span> <span\
  \ m='1945000'>invaders. I.e. the only way you could avoid it is</span> <span m='1949000'>if\
  \ this blastocyst was genetically identical to you.</span> </p><p><span m='1953000'>But\
  \ how can you make a blastocyst which is genetically identical to</span> <span m='1957000'>you?\
  \ Well, I'm glad I asked that question. That's really the big</span> <span m='1961000'>challenge\
  \ we have here because we don't want to create a situation</span> <span m='1965000'>where\
  \ we have to restore somebody's tissues, but the only way we can</span> <span m='1969000'>restore\
  \ them is to leave them immunosuppressed for the rest of</span> <span m='1973000'>their\
  \ lives. When I say immunosuppressed I mean we have to</span> <span m='1977000'>prevent\
  \ their immune system from attacking all of these cells that</span> <span m='1981000'>we've\
  \ injected in them, these foreign cells, in the same way</span> <span m='1985000'>that\
  \ we have to suppress the immune system of any person who has</span> <span m='1989000'>received\
  \ a graft from another individual including often bone</span> <span m='1993000'>marrow\
  \ transplants. In all cases, we have at least for a</span> <span m='1998000'>while\
  \ to prevent their immune system from attacking and eliminating these</span> <span\
  \ m='2004000'>engrafted cells. And this is where the whole strategy</span> <span\
  \ m='2009000'>comes for the whole process of cloning. You may recall the case of</span>\
  \ <span m='2013000'>Dolly about five years ago, and let's remember what happened</span>\
  \ <span m='2017000'>here because this would a momentous experiment in mammalian\
  \ biology.</span> </p><p><span m='2021000'>It asked the question, really, if you\
  \ take cells from a somatic tissue,</span> <span m='2025000'>from here, or here,\
  \ or here, are those cells,</span> <span m='2029000'>in principal, still totipotent,\
  \ i.e. is the nucleus, is the genome</span> <span m='2033000'>of those cells totipotent,\
  \ or has the genome, the chromosomal</span> <span m='2037000'>complement of cells\
  \ in their cells undergone some kind of irrevocable,</span> <span m='2041000'>irreversible\
  \ change, which precludes those cells from ever</span> <span m='2045000'>becoming\
  \ totipotent? Well, in fact,</span> <span m='2048000'>if you take mammary epithelial\
  \ cells from the breast of a human being or</span> <span m='2052000'>from the breast\
  \ of a ewe and you put them into the blastocyst,</span> <span m='2055000'>nothing's\
  \ going to happen. Those introduced mammary epithelial</span> <span m='2058000'>cells\
  \ will not be able to establish themselves in the blastocyst.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2062000'>And, we will not be able to insinuate themselves amidst the</span>\
  \ <span m='2065000'>inner cell mass, and they will not be able to</span> <span m='2069000'>participate\
  \ in embryogenesis. So therefore, the epigenetic program</span> <span m='2073000'>in\
  \ these somatic cells seems to be irrevocably set to preclude the</span> <span m='2078000'>participation\
  \ of the already differentiated mammary epithelial</span> <span m='2084000'>cells\
  \ in subsequent embryogenesis. Therefore, you could not do this</span> <span m='2089000'>experiment\
  \ all over again of introducing cells into the inner</span> <span m='2094000'>cell\
  \ mass as I just described over here, injecting them into this.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2100000'>But still, that doesn't answer the question. The issue is not whether</span>\
  \ <span m='2104000'>the mammary epithelial cell is irrevocably committed to being\
  \ a</span> <span m='2108000'>mammary epithelial cell. The issue: is its genome capable</span>\
  \ <span m='2112000'>under the proper circumstances of becoming an early embryonic\
  \ cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2116000'>And therefore, what was done is the following.\
  \ One took mammary</span> <span m='2121000'>epithelial cells, in this case from\
  \ Dolly's quote</span> <span m='2125000'>unquote \"mother, one prepared nuclei from\
  \ these</span> <span m='2129000'>cells, taking them out of the cytoplasm, and then\
  \ one got</span> <span m='2133000'>fertilized eggs or eggs that have been induced\
  \ to become.</span> </p><p><span m='2138000'>So here's an oocyte. An oocyte is an\
  \ unfertilized egg.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>In principle, you can activate\
  \ an oocyte by putting a sperm in,</span> <span m='2146000'>or in fact it's actually\
  \ better if you take the oocyte and you fool it</span> <span m='2151000'>into thinking\
  \ it's become fertilized by treating it with different salts,</span> <span m='2155000'>high\
  \ potassium concentration, and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>And that\
  \ will induce the egg to say I've been fertilized.</span> </p><p><span m='2164000'>I\
  \ better start embryogenesis. But what you do in this case is the</span> <span m='2169000'>following.\
  \ The egg has its own haploid nucleus here,</span> <span m='2173000'>and you can\
  \ take a little needle. And, you suck that nucleus right</span> <span m='2178000'>out\
  \ of the egg. So, you've enucleated it.</span> </p><p><span m='2183000'>That's what\
  \ you've done, and now the egg is enucleate.</span> </p><p><span m='2187000'>It\
  \ doesn't have a nucleus in it. But keep in mind,</span> <span m='2192000'>much\
  \ of what happens during early embryogenesis is programmed not only</span> <span\
  \ m='2196000'>by the genes but by all array of cytoplasmic proteins that are</span>\
  \ <span m='2201000'>present throughout the egg, and which play critical roles in</span>\
  \ <span m='2206000'>determining the subsequent course of embryogenesis.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2210000'>So now what you can do is you inject into this enucleate oocyte</span>\
  \ <span m='2215000'>the nucleus of a mammary epithelial cell.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2220000'>The mammary epithelial cell is obviously highly differentiated.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2225000'>It's there to make milk. We'll call it an MEC if you\
  \ want,</span> <span m='2230000'>and you put that in there, and under certain circumstances,</span>\
  \ <span m='2235000'>and then you can treat this with a little bit of salt to mimic\
  \ the</span> <span m='2240000'>physiological stimulus that comes after the sperm\
  \ hits the egg.</span> </p><p><span m='2245000'>And now this egg will think it's\
  \ been fertilized.</span> </p><p><span m='2251000'>And now it will begin to divide.\
  \ But keep in mind, the genome of</span> <span m='2255000'>this quote unquote \"\
  unfertilized egg\" has come not from the sperm and</span> <span m='2259000'>the\
  \ preexisting nucleus of the egg. It's come because the nucleus has</span> <span\
  \ m='2264000'>been injected from a mammary epithelial cell.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2268000'>An experience over the last 30 years had indicated that this will</span>\
  \ <span m='2272000'>never work. But finally somebody in Scotland, a man named Ian\
  \ Wilmouth</span> <span m='2277000'>tinkered enough with the conditions of these\
  \ cells that he could</span> <span m='2281000'>actually get it to work not so often,\
  \ maybe one, or two,</span> <span m='2285000'>or three times out of 100 tries. But\
  \ on those conditions,</span> <span m='2290000'>this thing would begin to divide.\
  \ The nucleus would begin to divide</span> <span m='2294000'>its diploid. Keep in\
  \ mind that when a sperm comes into an egg,</span> <span m='2299000'>the egg is\
  \ haploid. The sperm is haploid. Together they make a</span> <span m='2303000'>diploid\
  \ genome. This introduced genomus diploid,</span> <span m='2307000'>and the question\
  \ is, the critical question is, can the genes in this</span> <span m='2312000'>introduced\
  \ nucleus totally rearrange their transcriptional program so</span> <span m='2316000'>that\
  \ even though these genes might all be intact in terms of nucleotide</span> <span\
  \ m='2321000'>sequence, can the entire infinitely complex array of DNA associated</span>\
  \ <span m='2325000'>proteins, I.e. the proteins that constitute</span> <span m='2330000'>the\
  \ chromatin which is not only the histones but also the transcription</span> <span\
  \ m='2334000'>factors, the TF's, can they all jump on and jump off as</span> <span\
  \ m='2339000'>they should to mimic and replicate the spectrum of transcription</span>\
  \ <span m='2343000'>factors that is normally present shortly after an egg is fertilized?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2348000'>If they can do that, then this embryo can begin to</span>\
  \ <span m='2352000'>replicate, and can ultimately develop into a complete embryo.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2356000'>If they can't, then embryogenesis is going to be truncated\
  \ shortly</span> <span m='2360000'>thereafter maybe at the two cell stage, at the\
  \ four cell stage,</span> <span m='2364000'>at the 16 cell stage, but shortly thereafter,\
  \ not because of the DNA</span> <span m='2368000'>sequences being defective, but\
  \ because the spectrum of</span> <span m='2372000'>transcription factors is up and\
  \ down regulates certain genes is in fact</span> <span m='2376000'>not been able\
  \ to re-assort themselves in response to what?</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>Initially,\
  \ in response to the signals coming from the cytoplasm</span> <span m='2384000'>because\
  \ one might imagine, correctly so, that the nucleus in</span> <span m='2388000'>here\
  \ is getting signals from the cytoplasm telling it,</span> <span m='2393000'>in\
  \ effect, telling this nucleus, you should behave functionally as if</span> <span\
  \ m='2397000'>you were the nucleus of a fertilized egg. In other words,</span> <span\
  \ m='2401000'>the environment of proteins here is influencing the behavior</span>\
  \ <span m='2405000'>of this nucleus. That goes backwards to our normal</span> <span\
  \ m='2409000'>way of thinking because keep in mind our normal vectoral way of thinking</span>\
  \ <span m='2412000'>is that the nucleus is influencing the cytoplasm.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2414000'>That's the direction of information flow. But here,</span> <span m='2417000'>we're\
  \ having a different situation. Here, the cytoplasm is telling this</span> <span\
  \ m='2420000'>injected nucleus, well, you used to be a mammary</span> <span m='2423000'>epithelial\
  \ cell nucleus, but now you've got to take on a</span> <span m='2425000'>different\
  \ job. And we're going to force you to do</span> <span m='2428000'>so. And to the\
  \ extent that happens,</span> <span m='2432000'>then in principle, one can end up\
  \ having a normal embryo.</span> </p><p><span m='2436000'>And, it happened actually\
  \ on rare occasion that this worked.</span> </p><p><span m='2440000'>Here they used\
  \ actual electrical stimulus rather than salt to get the</span> <span m='2444000'>nucleus\
  \ to divide. This electrical stimulus,</span> <span m='2448000'>again, was to mimic\
  \ the stimulus that the sperm entering the egg</span> <span m='2452000'>normally\
  \ provides, thereby activating the egg and</span> <span m='2456000'>forcing the\
  \ entire fertilized egg to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>And so,\
  \ once this starts developing, let's say, the blastocyst stage,</span> <span m='2463000'>here\
  \ we have a blastocyst. You can see the inner cell mass</span> <span m='2467000'>once\
  \ again here. This can be transferred into a</span> <span m='2471000'>pseudo-pregnant\
  \ ewe. Pseudo-pregnant means you take a</span> <span m='2474000'>female ewe and\
  \ you inject it with a series of hormones that persuade her</span> <span m='2478000'>reproductive\
  \ system including prolactin, and progesterone,</span> <span m='2482000'>or estrogen,\
  \ persuade her reproductive system,</span> <span m='2485000'>her uterus, that she's\
  \ pregnant. You inject this early embryo into</span> <span m='2489000'>her, and\
  \ this early embryo will then implant into the wall of her uterus</span> <span m='2493000'>and\
  \ begin to develop. And if it all works well,</span> <span m='2497000'>you get a\
  \ Dolly is born. You get a new sheep coming out of this.</span> </p><p><span m='2501000'>It\
  \ doesn't work so often, one, two, three, four times after out of</span> <span m='2506000'>a\
  \ hundred, and very often in the great majority of cases,</span> <span m='2510000'>there\
  \ are mis-births, mis-carriages, which happen in the middle of</span> <span m='2515000'>embryogenesis.\
  \ So, almost in the great majority of</span> <span m='2519000'>cases, this fails.\
  \ Somehow, the reprogramming of this</span> <span m='2524000'>nucleus, which is\
  \ what we're talking about, reprogramming it in terms of</span> <span m='2528000'>its\
  \ transcriptional program, goes awry. And therefore, bad</span> <span m='2532000'>things\
  \ happen. The fact that on a rare occasion</span> <span m='2537000'>gets and succeeds\
  \ here already is extremely interesting because it</span> <span m='2541000'>proves\
  \ irrevocably that the genome of a mammary epithelial cell is in</span> <span m='2545000'>principle\
  \ competent to program entire embryonic development.</span> </p><p><span m='2550000'>And\
  \ that means that during the development of Dolly's mother,</span> <span m='2554000'>we'll\
  \ put her up here, as she developed from one cell into 1,</span> <span m='2559000'>00\
  \ or 10,000 billion cells, as that development occurred the DNA</span> <span m='2564000'>sequences\
  \ that went from the fertilized egg to her didn't really</span> <span m='2569000'>change.\
  \ I.e. the DNA sequences that were in one of her mammary</span> <span m='2573000'>epithelial\
  \ cells were intact, and as capable in principle of</span> <span m='2578000'>launching\
  \ the full-fledged development as would be</span> <span m='2583000'>a fertilized\
  \ egg. And that is one of the proofs,</span> <span m='2588000'>by the way, that\
  \ in fact differentiation does not involve,</span> <span m='2592000'>with some rare\
  \ exceptions, alterations in DNA sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='2596000'>This,\
  \ in turn, ends up being connected with the whole issue of</span> <span m='2600000'>embryonic\
  \ stem cells. Let's say that I wanted to have my</span> <span m='2604000'>muscles\
  \ regenerated, although they're still pretty good.</span> </p><p><span m='2608000'>So,\
  \ I take a skin cell of mine, and I inject the skin cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2613000'>I\
  \ take the nucleus out, and I inject it into an oocyte.</span> </p><p><span m='2616000'>And\
  \ then I let the oocyte develop up to this stage.</span> </p><p><span m='2620000'>And\
  \ I don't put the oocyte back into a sheep or another woman,</span> <span m='2624000'>although\
  \ I could in principle. I actually take the cells out of the</span> <span m='2628000'>inner\
  \ cell mass. Those are ES cells,</span> <span m='2631000'>and I begin to use them\
  \ to regenerate my muscles to do this</span> <span m='2635000'>strategy. So, the\
  \ cells are, in this case,</span> <span m='2639000'>not used for reproductive cloning,\
  \ which is what this is here.</span> </p><p><span m='2643000'>They're used for therapeutic\
  \ cloning, where instead of taking these cells</span> <span m='2647000'>and the\
  \ ES cells and allowing them to form a whole embryo,</span> <span m='2651000'>they're\
  \ used to form a cell line of ES cells from the blastocyst from</span> <span m='2655000'>the\
  \ inner cell mass. What we talked about before,</span> <span m='2659000'>here you\
  \ see the blastocyst with the inner cell mass here.</span> </p><p><span m='2663000'>You\
  \ see it again. But now, rather than allowing this blastocyst</span> <span m='2667000'>to\
  \ continue development, we simply extract cells from it and</span> <span m='2671000'>again\
  \ create ES cells. I could create therefore in</span> <span m='2674000'>principle,\
  \ ES cells, which are genetically identical to</span> <span m='2678000'>all the\
  \ cells in my body, and any one of you could as well.</span> </p><p><span m='2681000'>And\
  \ here, there's not only one, but there's two ethical complications.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2684000'>First of all, here we're starting human life with the intent of</span>\
  \ <span m='2688000'>truncating it very early, and secondly, where are the oocytes</span>\
  \ <span m='2691000'>going to come from? Well, you could say you can get</span> <span\
  \ m='2694000'>them from some women, but producing oocytes from a human</span> <span\
  \ m='2698000'>female isn't so easy. You have to inject her with all</span> <span\
  \ m='2702000'>kinds of stimulatory hormones, choreogramatatrophic hormones. It's</span>\
  \ <span m='2706000'>an unpleasant procedure. Usually women are paid $5,</span> <span\
  \ m='2710000'>00 or $10,000 to produce some oocytes. Well,</span> <span m='2714000'>you\
  \ say, that's OK, but is that OK? I don't know.</span> </p><p><span m='2718000'>Is\
  \ it OK to pay a woman to donate her oocytes to make herself into an</span> <span\
  \ m='2722000'>oocyte factory? I don't know. You have to judge.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2726000'>I think there's arguments both for and against it.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2730000'>Clearly, any one of us would be extraordinarily na\xEFve if we thought</span>\
  \ <span m='2734000'>that this was a procedure which had no ethical encumbrances\
  \ in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2739000'>And, you have to think about them for yourself.\
  \ Still,</span> <span m='2743000'>the potentials are enormous, and therefore the\
  \ question exists.</span> </p><p><span m='2748000'>Will there be ways in the future\
  \ of taking differentiated cells from</span> <span m='2753000'>one's tissue, and\
  \ in fact using them in these ways to make ES cells</span> <span m='2757000'>without\
  \ having to go through an oocyte, and without having the</span> <span m='2762000'>potential\
  \ of creating human life. The alternative to this has been to</span> <span m='2766000'>do\
  \ the following, to go into our normal tissues and</span> <span m='2770000'>pull\
  \ out adult stem cells. What do I mean by adult stem cells?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2774000'>These are not stem cells that are totipotent. These are stem cells</span>\
  \ <span m='2778000'>which are in my muscles and regenerating muscle mass,</span>\
  \ <span m='2782000'>which happens believe it or not. These are stem cells which\
  \ might be</span> <span m='2786000'>in my skin and are continually regenerating\
  \ skin cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2790000'>Keep in mind that in the maintenance\
  \ of all our normal tissues there are</span> <span m='2794000'>stem cells whose\
  \ configuration can formally be depicted like this with</span> <span m='2798000'>the\
  \ transit amplifying cells we talked about before.</span> </p><p><span m='2802000'>And\
  \ maybe, if one took the stem cells out of an adult tissue right</span> <span m='2806000'>here,\
  \ if we had a way of extracting them, those could be propagated in</span> <span\
  \ m='2810000'>vitro, and then injected back in. Those are so-called adult stem</span>\
  \ <span m='2814000'>cells. And the individuals who are against</span> <span m='2818000'>this\
  \ kind of manipulation of human embryos and so forth say that adult</span> <span\
  \ m='2822000'>stem cells are really the solution. You take stem cells out of a</span>\
  \ <span m='2826000'>person's tissue, you expand them. Ex vivo means out</span> <span\
  \ m='2830000'>of the body, in vitro, and then you use them. You inject</span> <span\
  \ m='2834000'>them into somebody's tissue to regenerate their tissue.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2839000'>There's only one problem with that. It's ethically far less encumbered</span>\
  \ <span m='2843000'>obviously, but it doesn't work that well. In fact,</span> <span\
  \ m='2847000'>some people think it hardly works at all, that the exceptions are\
  \ really</span> <span m='2851000'>rather far and few between. And so, this issue\
  \ will long be or</span> <span m='2856000'>continue to be debated. But it obviously\
  \ represents a very</span> <span m='2861000'>new and exciting area of biomedical\
  \ research. And interestingly enough,</span> <span m='2866000'>it impinges as well\
  \ in a fully unexpected way on cancer because</span> <span m='2872000'>this whole\
  \ paradigm of stem cells, it turns out, also applies to cancer</span> <span m='2877000'>cells.\
  \ If you were to have asked me two or</span> <span m='2881000'>three years ago,\
  \ what did the cells in the tumor look</span> <span m='2885000'>like? I would draw\
  \ a picture like this, that these are a series of</span> <span m='2889000'>exponentially\
  \ growing cells so that all the cancer cells,</span> <span m='2892000'>all the neoplastic\
  \ cells in the tumor mass are biologically</span> <span m='2896000'>equivalent to\
  \ one another. They all have the same mutant</span> <span m='2900000'>genome, and\
  \ they all are capable of multiplying exponentially.</span> </p><p><span m='2903000'>But\
  \ it turns out that work in the Matavoidic system on Matevoidic</span> <span m='2907000'>tumors\
  \ like leukemias, and now on breast cancers,</span> <span m='2911000'>yields a very\
  \ different results, because it turns out that the way</span> <span m='2916000'>that\
  \ the tumors are organized looks like this. The tumors also are</span> <span m='2924000'>organized\
  \ in this hierarchical array just like normal tissue.</span> </p><p><span m='2932000'>How\
  \ do we know that? Again, I'm glad I asked that question.</span> </p><p><span m='2940000'>Because\
  \ if you take these cells out of the tumor and put them in another</span> <span\
  \ m='2944000'>mouse, let's say, you get a new tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='2948000'>These\
  \ cells are tumorogenic, I.e. they concede a new tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='2953000'>If\
  \ you take these cells out of the tumor, they have the same mutant</span> <span\
  \ m='2957000'>genome. They constitute the bulk, the vast mass of the cancer cells\
  \ in</span> <span m='2961000'>a tumor. You put these into a mouse, and they're non-tumorogenic.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2966000'>And, in some kinds of tumors, the tumorogenic cells can\
  \ represent</span> <span m='2970000'>only 1 or 2% of the total mass of cancer cells\
  \ in the tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='2975000'>And from this, we begin to realize\
  \ that you look</span> <span m='2978000'>inside tumors: the tumors deviate minimally\
  \ from the organization of</span> <span m='2982000'>normal tissue. They also depend\
  \ on self-renewing</span> <span m='2986000'>stem cells which can make transit amplifying\
  \ cells and can give end</span> <span m='2990000'>stage cells, which although they're\
  \ neoplastic, have many of the</span> <span m='2993000'>differentiated characteristics\
  \ of the normal tissue from which they</span> <span m='2997000'>arose. And this\
  \ has enormous implications for,</span> <span m='3001000'>for example, therapies\
  \ against tumors.</span> </p><p><span m='3005000'>If you ask somebody, how do you\
  \ develop and how you judge</span> <span m='3009000'>the success of an anticancer\
  \ treatment? You talk to somebody</span> <span m='3013000'>like from the pharmaceutical\
  \ industry. And let's say that's easy.</span> </p><p><span m='3017000'>If you have\
  \ a new drug, and that drug reduces the mass of a</span> <span m='3021000'>tumor\
  \ by 50%, that means that you've done something really good.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3026000'>But let's look what's going on here. If these cells are 99% of the\
  \ tumor</span> <span m='3030000'>in terms of the mass and these cells are 1% of\
  \ the tumor,</span> <span m='3034000'>let's say you've invented a new drug which\
  \ wipes out all of these cells</span> <span m='3038000'>but doesn't touch these\
  \ cells. The bulk of the tumor has shrunk and</span> <span m='3042000'>everybody\
  \ will say, eureka, we've succeeded in curing</span> <span m='3046000'>cancer. But\
  \ keep in mind that the self-renewing capacity of the tumor</span> <span m='3050000'>rests\
  \ in these cells. And if these cells are allowed to</span> <span m='3053000'>survive,\
  \ then they'll start proliferating again and regenerate</span> <span m='3057000'>the\
  \ entire tumor mass. And you won't really know that you</span> <span m='3061000'>had\
  \ any success because these cells look like all the other tumor cells</span> <span\
  \ m='3065000'>under the microscope. But biologically, they're very</span> <span\
  \ m='3070000'>different. And therefore, the future of cancer therapy,</span> <span\
  \ m='3074000'>and it will take five or ten years to do this, has to begin to focus\
  \ on</span> <span m='3079000'>getting rid of these self-renewing stem cells which\
  \ create this</span> <span m='3083000'>enormous regenerative capacity on the part\
  \ of tumors.</span> </p><p><span m='3088000'>See you next Monday. Have a great vacation.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3092000'>Eat much turkey, and get some exercise, and don't smoke.</span>\
