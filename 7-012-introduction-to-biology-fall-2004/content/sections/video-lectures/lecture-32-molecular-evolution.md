title: 'Lecture 32: Molecular Evolution'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>So we're shifting gears today. We're going to talk about
  molecular</span> <span m='4000'>evolution, i.e. how do we understand how species</span>
  <span m='8000'>evolve, how do we understand a lot about ourselves,</span> <span
  m='12000'>how human evolution is taking place over the last couple hundred</span>
  <span m='17000'>thousand years. And traditionally,</span> <span m='21000'>evolution
  has been the purview of people who study the morphology of</span> <span m='25000'>organisms,
  and when I talk about morphology, obviously I'm talking</span> <span m='29000'>about
  shape and form. And by comparing organisms,</span> <span m='34000'>starting already
  250 years ago, one began to develop hierarchies of</span> <span m='38000'>how different
  organisms on the planet are related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='43000'>You've
  seen this, undoubtedly, in high school biology.</span> </p><p><span m='47000'>This
  is the study of phylogeny, and phylogeny has traditionally been</span> <span m='57000'>figured
  out by comparing the phenotypes, the morphologies of</span> <span m='60000'>adults,
  sometimes embryonic development, and on that basis,</span> <span m='63000'>attempting
  to extrapolate back in evolutionary time,</span> <span m='66000'>about the relatedness
  of different organisms, one to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='70000'>And in so
  doing, one has been able to create,</span> <span m='74000'>for example, family trees,
  here's something that Charles Darwin was</span> <span m='78000'>already interested
  in, the various kinds of finches on the</span> <span m='82000'>Galapagos Islands
  off Peru, in the Pacific. And here, one is</span> <span m='87000'>beginning to organize
  different bird species on the basis of whether</span> <span m='91000'>they're more
  closely or less closely related to one another,</span> <span m='95000'>and to draw
  pedigrees, which, one imagines, describe how they</span> <span m='99000'>evolved,
  one from the other. i.e., organisms which are very</span> <span m='104000'>similar
  to one another must be more closely related evolutionarily,</span> <span m='108000'>and
  conversely, those that appear very differently from one another,</span> <span m='113000'>morphologically,
  must be far more distantly related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='118000'>In
  fact, these kinds of morphologic extrapolations can be very</span> <span m='122000'>misleading.
  So here, for example, are two kinds of eyes.</span> </p><p><span m='127000'>The
  top eye is a Drysophila eye</span> <span m='131000'>which, to state the obvious,
  looks a lot different from our eyes,</span> <span m='134000'>which is that the chordate
  eyes shown the bottom.</span> </p><p><span m='138000'>Totally different. Our rods
  and cones face backwards,</span> <span m='141000'>the Drysophila Arthropod eyes,
  the light sensors face forward.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>Everything is different.
  And on the basis of that,</span> <span m='147000'>you would say that these two organisms
  are independent</span> <span m='150000'>evolutionary inventions, that they've been
  invented on two</span> <span m='154000'>occasions, and that they have no relatedness,
  one to the</span> <span m='157000'>other, at all. But I will tell you an extraordinary</span>
  <span m='161000'>experiment. You can take, there's a master gene that controls</span>
  <span m='165000'>eye development in the fly, Drosophila. It's called eyeless,</span>
  <span m='170000'>if you knock it out then the eye doesn't develop at all.</span>
  </p><p><span m='175000'>And you can take out of the mouse, what is apparently a
  related gene</span> <span m='179000'>called small eye, so the fly gene is called
  eyeless</span> <span m='184000'>and the mouse gene is called small eye. And you
  can put the small-eyed</span> <span m='189000'>gene into the Drosophila genome,
  in a fly that lacks the eyeless gene.</span> </p><p><span m='193000'>So here we're
  talking about two</span> <span m='198000'>different genes. The fly gene is called
  eyeless,</span> <span m='202000'>the mammalian gene, at least in mouse, is called
  small eye.</span> </p><p><span m='206000'>If you knock out this gene in the fly
  genome, and replace it with this</span> <span m='210000'>gene, you get a perfectly
  normal Drosophila eye.</span> </p><p><span m='214000'>It's extraordinary. Or you
  can do the following,</span> <span m='218000'>you can arrange it so that the mouse
  small eye gene is expressed</span> <span m='222000'>ectopically. When I say ectopically,</span>
  <span m='226000'>I mean that it's expressed in the wrong place, at the wrong time.</span>
  </p><p><span m='231000'>So you can do the following experiment. In a fly genome,</span>
  <span m='236000'>you can arrange it so that the mouse small eye gene becomes expressed
  on</span> <span m='240000'>one of the extremities of the fly, on one of the legs
  of the fly. And</span> <span m='245000'>now, on one of the extremities of the fly,
  an ectopic eye will develop,</span> <span m='250000'>looks just like a Drosophila
  eye, but it's development is programmed</span> <span m='255000'>by the mouse small
  eye gene. What I'm telling you is that these</span> <span m='259000'>two genes are
  totally interchangeable,</span> <span m='263000'>that they are effectively indistinguishable
  from one another,</span> <span m='267000'>functionally they have some sequence relatedness,
  but in terms of the way</span> <span m='271000'>they program development, they are
  effectively equivalent.</span> </p><p><span m='274000'>And what this means is that
  the progenitor of these two genes</span> <span m='278000'>must've already existed
  at the time that the flies and we diverged,</span> <span m='282000'>which six or
  seven-hundred million years ago, and in the intervening</span> <span m='286000'>six
  or seven-hundred million years, these genes have been totally</span> <span m='290000'>unchanged.
  i.e., once the gene was developed,</span> <span m='293000'>evolution could not tinker
  with it, and begin to change it in different</span> <span m='297000'>ways, ostensibly
  because such tinkering would render these genes</span> <span m='300000'>dysfunctional,
  and thereby would inactivate them,</span> <span m='304000'>thereby depriving the
  organism of a critical sensory organ.</span> </p><p><span m='308000'>So here we
  have an example, a dramatic example, of how</span> <span m='311000'>morphology misleads
  us. Here we have an example of where we</span> <span m='315000'>would say these
  two eyes, the two eyes I've shown you here,</span> <span m='318000'>are so different
  from one another that they must,</span> <span m='322000'>by necessity, be independent
  evolutionary inventions.</span> </p><p><span m='326000'>But in fact, genetics tells
  us, and these gene-swapping experiments,</span> <span m='329000'>tell us that the
  two eyes descend from a common ancestral eye,</span> <span m='333000'>a prototypical
  eye, whose precise morphology we can't discern anymore.</span> </p><p><span m='337000'>And
  so we begin to realize that if we really want to understand</span> <span m='341000'>evolution
  and we really want to understand phylogeny,</span> <span m='344000'>phylogeny being
  how the species are related to one another,</span> <span m='348000'>we have to the
  DNA, and we have to begin to look not at phenotype,</span> <span m='352000'>but
  we have to look instead, at genotype.</span> </p><p><span m='356000'>The Darwinian
  model is pretty much like this, the survival of the</span> <span m='361000'>fittest.
  And when I say that, we imagine that we have here, a</span> <span m='366000'>genetically
  heterogeneous group of organisms within a species,</span> <span m='371000'>and this,
  this number of individuals in the species could be 100,</span> <span m='376000'>it
  could be 1,000,000. This particular individual,</span> <span m='382000'>by chance,
  acquires a mutation, or an advantageous allele, through</span> <span m='387000'>some
  genetic alteration. This genotype renders this organism</span> <span m='392000'>more
  fit, phenotypically, has a selective advantage and</span> <span m='396000'>consequently,
  over extended periods of time, which may be thousands or</span> <span m='400000'>even
  millions of years, the descendents of the organism</span> <span m='404000'>bearing
  this allele now have advantage, have greater reproductive</span> <span m='408000'>advantage,
  survival advantage, compared with the other individuals</span> <span m='412000'>in
  the same species, and therefore, the representation of</span> <span m='416000'>this
  mutant allele in the gene pool of the species becomes expanded.</span> </p><p><span
  m='420000'>When I say gene pool, I'm talking bout the common shared</span> <span
  m='423000'>set of genes within the species, such as within the human species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='427000'>And so eventually, the descendents of this organism,</span>
  <span m='430000'>or the descendants of an organism bearing this allele,</span> <span
  m='434000'>now become overrepresented in the population, because they're more fit.</span>
  </p><p><span m='437000'>And then there can be another succession, i.</span> </p><p><span
  m='441000'>., there could be other mutations occurring subsequently.</span> </p><p><span
  m='444000'>Once again, favoring the selective outgrowth of an individual bearing</span>
  <span m='448000'>this allele, or this allele. And in addition,</span> <span m='451000'>there
  can be the process of what one calls, speciation.</span> </p><p><span m='455000'>That
  is to say, that if some parts of the species live in one place,</span> <span m='458000'>and
  other parts of the species live in another place,</span> <span m='462000'>geographically,
  they may no longer interbreed, and as a consequence,</span> <span m='465000'>and
  because of the fact they're under different selective pressures,</span> <span m='469000'>they
  may begin to diverge from another if, evolutionary speaking,</span> <span m='472000'>because
  they're no longer actively exchanging genes within one another.</span> </p><p><span
  m='476000'>And, as a consequence, one can have new species arriving.</span> </p><p><span
  m='480000'>And what one believes, this happens over slow,</span> <span m='483000'>slowly
  over evolutionary time, but it does arise, and to the extent</span> <span m='487000'>it
  does, one eventually ends up with organisms here and here,</span> <span m='491000'>which
  can no longer effectively interbreed with one another.</span> </p><p><span m='495000'>That
  is to say, they become genetically so different from one</span> <span m='498000'>another,
  that any hybrids formed between them are,</span> <span m='502000'>in fact, sterile,
  for one reason or another, if they're at all</span> <span m='506000'>interested
  in breeding with one another to begin with.</span> </p><p><span m='510000'>And what
  this means is that we can begin to trace how closely or</span> <span m='513000'>distantly
  related species are to one another, simply by asking how</span> <span m='517000'>closely
  or similarly related are their DNA sequences?</span> </p><p><span m='520000'>If,
  distantly related organisms have very distantly related</span> <span m='524000'>sequences,
  and closely related organisms must have sequences which</span> <span m='528000'>are
  very similar to one another. And over evolutionary time, there's</span> <span m='531000'>a
  so-called mutational clock, where one, where each species</span> <span m='535000'>accumulates
  a certain number of point mutations,</span> <span m='539000'>base substitutions
  in it's DNA, per million years, and the longer</span> <span m='542000'>the two species
  are separated from one another, the greater will be the</span> <span m='546000'>difference
  in their sequence diversity.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>And on that simple basis,
  one can begin to construct</span> <span m='554000'>evolutionary trees of, for example,
  the entire cellular</span> <span m='558000'>life on the planet. And here's such
  an evolutionary</span> <span m='562000'>tree, where what's being compared is the
  ribosomal RNA sequences,</span> <span m='567000'>i.e., the small ribosomal RNA.
  Remember, ribosomes have two</span> <span m='571000'>subunits, small and large,
  in the case of prokaryotes,</span> <span m='575000'>it's 16S RNA, that is, it's
  sedimentation rate.</span> </p><p><span m='579000'>In the case of mammals, it's
  18S. In both cases,</span> <span m='583000'>these are small ribosomal RNA subunits.
  The ribosome was only</span> <span m='587000'>invented on one occasion during the
  evolution of life on the planet,</span> <span m='591000'>so one can begin to compare
  since all cellular life forms have life</span> <span m='595000'>forms, one can ask
  how similar, or dissimilar, are the various</span> <span m='598000'>sequences and
  coding, in small ribosomal RNA subunits?</span> </p><p><span m='602000'>And on the
  basis of that, one has concluded that there are actually</span> <span m='606000'>three
  branches of cellular life on the planet.</span> </p><p><span m='610000'>The bacteria
  indicated here, this is not such a great Xerox,</span> <span m='613000'>where you
  see a whole series of different kinds of bacteria,</span> <span m='617000'>indicated
  on this tree. Sorry about the poor reproduction.</span> </p><p><span m='620000'>Here
  there's a dashed line indicating that we're talking,</span> <span m='624000'>there's
  a second kingdom in the middle here, indicated by what are</span> <span m='628000'>called
  archae, and the archae are also,</span> <span m='631000'>from our point of view,
  prokaryotes, but they're not bacteria. They are</span> <span m='635000'>a single-cell
  life form, they're often found in unusual</span> <span m='639000'>situations, for
  instance, in thermal vents in the bottom of</span> <span m='642000'>the ocean floor,
  some of them are able to stand high</span> <span m='646000'>salt, some of them are
  able to stand high temperature,</span> <span m='650000'>like therma fillus, therma
  proteus, and so fourth.</span> </p><p><span m='654000'>And these, their ribosomal
  RNAs, are so different from those of</span> <span m='658000'>bacteria, that they've
  been placed in their own separate kingdom.</span> </p><p><span m='662000'>And finally,
  here are the eukaryotes, all over here.</span> </p><p><span m='666000'>These are
  all eukaryotic cells, starting here. And we, our cells,</span> <span m='670000'>seem
  to be slightly more closely related to those of the Archaea,</span> <span m='674000'>if
  you follow this ribosomal sequences, than they are to</span> <span m='678000'>the
  actual bacteria. So, there's actually two major</span> <span m='682000'>prokaryotic
  life forms on the planet. The first living organism,</span> <span m='686000'>well
  if you begin to try to look back in geological record,</span> <span m='690000'>it
  looks like the first living cellular life forms existed already</span> <span m='694000'>3-3.5
  billion years ago, not so long after the planet was</span> <span m='698000'>formed,
  which was between 4. and 4.5 billion years ago. And</span> <span m='702000'>here's
  the whole eukaryotic tree, and if we look at the eukaryotic</span> <span m='706000'>trees,
  remembering here that we're starting at 3.5 billion years ago,</span> <span m='710000'>And
  we're using this evolutionary clock to determine relatedness,</span> <span m='713000'>then
  we see a whole series of single-cell eukaryotes,</span> <span m='716000'>here are
  their names are, these are protozoan, eukaryotic</span> <span m='720000'>protozoan.
  Here's Amoeba, here are slime molds, here are</span> <span m='723000'>cilliates,
  we're still at single-cell organisms.</span> </p><p><span m='727000'>Finally we
  get to multi-cellular organisms, plants,</span> <span m='730000'>fungi, and animals,
  and so, all animals on the planet</span> <span m='734000'>are a relatively recent
  invention. All animals, all of the metazoan,</span> <span m='737000'>are just on
  this very small branch, and we know that this very small</span> <span m='741000'>branch
  started around 600-650 million years ago,</span> <span m='745000'>maybe 700 million
  years ago. And that was the time, roughly</span> <span m='749000'>speaking, when
  we and flies last had our common ancestor,</span> <span m='752000'>otherwise, to
  state the obvious, we and flies are very different.</span> </p><p><span m='756000'>The
  fact that the gene for encoding the eye has been conserved,</span> <span m='760000'>so
  faithfully, over enormous evolutionary period of time</span> <span m='764000'>indicates
  something else, And that is, certain genes can</span> <span m='768000'>evolve progressively
  over a long period of time,</span> <span m='772000'>because they don't encode vital
  functions, or they may even be</span> <span m='777000'>sequences between genes that
  don't encode phenotype at all.</span> </p><p><span m='782000'>Imagine, for example,
  we have a situation were here we have a gene</span> <span m='786000'>which encodes
  a vital function, like the eye, here's another gene</span> <span m='791000'>that
  encodes another function, oh I don't know, a leg.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>And
  here we have intergenic sequences. After all,</span> <span m='799000'>as you have
  learned by now, more than 96% of the DNA in our</span> <span m='803000'>genome,
  doesn't encode proteins, and probably isn't even responsible</span> <span m='807000'>for
  regulating genes. So these sequences, right in here,</span> <span m='811000'>can
  mutate freely during the course of evolution, without having a</span> <span m='814000'>deleterious
  effect on the phenotype of the organism.</span> </p><p><span m='818000'>There's
  no evolutionary pressure to constrain the evolution of these</span> <span m='822000'>genes,
  but if this gene over here encodes an eyes,</span> <span m='826000'>And if this
  gene has been optimized in it's sequence,</span> <span m='829000'>early in the course
  of evolution, that any subsequently occurring</span> <span m='833000'>mutations
  will compromise it's function, and therefore there's</span> <span m='837000'>enormous
  selective pressure to eliminate any organism which has</span> <span m='840000'>begun
  to tinker with the sequence of this gene, by changing it's sequence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='844000'>Here, in stark contrast, there's no such selective pressure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='848000'>The organism, that is,</span> <span m='851000'>can tinker at will with
  this. I don't mean literally that the</span> <span m='854000'>organism is able to
  tinker with it's own DNA sequences,</span> <span m='858000'>but the hand of evolution
  can change these sequences in here,</span> <span m='861000'>at will, without having
  any effect on the viability of the organism on</span> <span m='864000'>it's selective,
  or Darwinian, fitness,</span> <span m='867000'>and therefore, such mutations in
  these, in these sequences,</span> <span m='870000'>are neutral mutation, they have
  on effect on phenotype,</span> <span m='874000'>and they will not be eliminated
  from the gene pool.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>Again here, mutations in these
  vital, critical genes will be</span> <span m='880000'>eliminated from the gene pool.
  So that's another one of the</span> <span m='883000'>principles in molecular evolution
  that we want to talk about.</span> </p><p><span m='886000'>And if you follow these
  principles, we can not only do, draw</span> <span m='890000'>evolutionary trees
  like this, which have a grand scope, a scale of</span> <span m='893000'>three and
  a half billion years, we can talk, for example, about how</span> <span m='896000'>different
  kinds of bears are related to one another,</span> <span m='900000'>and on the basis,
  once again, of their DNA sequence.</span> </p><p><span m='903000'>Or, if you want,
  we can even look at how different kinds of</span> <span m='906000'>domesticated
  animals are related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='910000'>This is kind
  of a fun undertaking. Look at this. Why is it fun? Well</span> <span m='914000'>it's,
  it's kind of an amusing idea, how often were cows domesticated</span> <span m='919000'>during
  the history of humanity? How often were sheep domesticated?</span> </p><p><span
  m='923000'>Pigs, water buffalos, and horses. And what you see here is that cattle</span>
  <span m='928000'>were domesticated on two occasions, probably once in Western Asia,
  the</span> <span m='932000'>middle east, and once in Eastern Asia. Sheep were domesticated
  twice,</span> <span m='937000'>all modern sheep following these two families here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='942000'>Obviously they share a common ancestor someway back,</span>
  <span m='946000'>but most sheep either fall here or here. Pigs seem to have been</span>
  <span m='950000'>domesticated twice, once over here and once over here,</span> <span
  m='954000'>water buffalos twice, horses are very confusing,</span> <span m='958000'>it
  looks like they were domesticated on several occasions because they're</span> <span
  m='962000'>all over the map, they're not two clusters of</span> <span m='966000'>closely-related
  varieties, like here and here. What others,</span> <span m='970000'>dogs, that's
  recently, I forget what the number is for dogs, once.</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>Dogs
  were domesticated once, probably the earliest domestication,</span> <span m='978000'>about
  100,000 years ago. They all have one common radiating tree,</span> <span m='982000'>here
  we have two radiating trees, one cluster over here, one cluster</span> <span m='986000'>over
  here, with sheep, pigs, and so fourth. So we can even,</span> <span m='991000'>so
  you can learn an enormous amount about even the history of</span> <span m='995000'>agriculture,
  by looking at these kinds of DNA pedigree.</span> </p><p><span m='1000000'>Here's
  some other interesting principles. Mitochondrial DNA</span> <span m='1004000'>passes
  always from the mother, so when a fertilized egg is formed,</span> <span m='1009000'>Dad
  gives his chromosomes, but he doesn't donate for any,</span> <span m='1013000'>doesn't
  donate any mitochondrial DNA. I remember visiting a friend in</span> <span m='1018000'>North
  Carolina in 1974, and he was looking at the</span> <span m='1023000'>mitochondrial
  DNA of mules and, when you breed a horse and a donkey,</span> <span m='1027000'>what
  do you get out? You get a mule out,</span> <span m='1032000'>or, what happens if
  you do it the other way? What happens if the</span> <span m='1038000'>father is
  a horse, and the mother is a donkey?</span> </p><p><span m='1044000'>It's a hinny,
  it's actually called a hinny. So there's two ways of</span> <span m='1050000'>breeding,
  and the question is now, and by the way, it's not so nice to</span> <span m='1056000'>have
  a father being the horse and the mother being the mule.</span> </p><p><span m='1062000'>Why?
  Because Mom isn't used to carrying an embryo that's much</span> <span m='1065000'>larger
  than she's adapted to. The other way is fine, because then</span> <span m='1069000'>she
  can carry a small embryo, but if Dad comes from a much larger</span> <span m='1073000'>species,
  then the fetus that the female donkey must carry,</span> <span m='1077000'>is larger
  than her womb is really evolved to carry.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>So, you
  don't often see these hinnies around because they cause</span> <span m='1084000'>great
  difficulty at birth. In any case, why did I get into</span> <span m='1088000'>this
  digression? Glad I asked that.</span> </p><p><span m='1092000'>The question was,
  where did the mitochondrial DNA come?</span> </p><p><span m='1095000'>1974, this
  was still a hot question. And it turned out,</span> <span m='1099000'>the mitochondrial
  DNA in both the mules and the hinnies came always</span> <span m='1102000'>from
  Mom. There was not a trace of mitochondrial DNA from the father</span> <span m='1106000'>and,
  as a consequence, this begins to cause us to realize</span> <span m='1109000'>where
  our mitochondrial DNA comes from. So his mitochondrial DNA</span> <span m='1113000'>comes
  from his mother, his maternal grandmother,</span> <span m='1116000'>her mother,
  her mother before her, and so fourth, and the same for each</span> <span m='1120000'>one
  of you. And what this means is that if you</span> <span m='1123000'>look at a pedigree
  like this, and for example, here we have a</span> <span m='1127000'>mother and a
  father, girls are always round,</span> <span m='1130000'>boys are square. And here
  you'll see the mitochondrial DNA,</span> <span m='1134000'>it's donated to all of
  the children, but the fact is that these boys,</span> <span m='1137000'>when they
  mate, when they have offspring,</span> <span m='1141000'>they will no longer pass
  along her mitochondrial DNA,</span> <span m='1145000'>so it will be lost. And the
  only way the mitochondrial</span> <span m='1148000'>DNA can be transmitted is through
  one of her daughters,</span> <span m='1152000'>who in turn, have daughters. Here
  you see the situation where</span> <span m='1156000'>almost all of her mitochondrial
  DNA is lost, except for this female</span> <span m='1160000'>descendent who, once
  again, passes it on to her sons</span> <span m='1164000'>and daughters. Only the
  daughters,</span> <span m='1168000'>again, can transmit mitochondrial DNA. And there
  is equity in life,</span> <span m='1173000'>it doesn't often happen. Jack Kennedy
  said life is unfair,</span> <span m='1177000'>but sometimes it's reasonably fair,
  but here is the y-chromosomes, the</span> <span m='1181000'>y-counterpart. Keep
  in mind, the y-chromosome only</span> <span m='1186000'>passes from father-to-son,
  to father-to-son, and exactly the</span> <span m='1190000'>same dynamics apply.
  And importantly, this is critical</span> <span m='1194000'>for our thinking now,
  neither the y-chromosome nor the</span> <span m='1198000'>mitochondrial DNA recombines
  with another chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='1202000'>And therefore, the complexities
  of diploid mendelian genetics are</span> <span m='1206000'>obviated. So when you're
  looking at, for example, the mitochondrial DNA,</span> <span m='1210000'>you can
  look at the pure results of accumulated mutations,</span> <span m='1214000'>You
  don't have to worry about crossing-over,</span> <span m='1217000'>you don't have
  to worry about exchange of portions of a gene</span> <span m='1221000'>between two
  homologous chromosomes. It doesn't happen with the</span> <span m='1225000'>y-chromosome
  because there's only one of them in the cell,</span> <span m='1229000'>and it doesn't
  happen with the mitochondrial DNA because there's no</span> <span m='1233000'>other
  DNA for it to equilibrate with. As a consequence,</span> <span m='1237000'>we can
  begin to think about what happens with mitochondrial DNA and</span> <span m='1241000'>y-chromosomal
  DNA, in young and old species.</span> </p><p><span m='1245000'>So let's talk about
  a recently formed species,</span> <span m='1248000'>and let's say we have a young
  species down here,</span> <span m='1252000'>below the illustration, and now this
  species, which has</span> <span m='1255000'>recently come into existence for whatever
  reason,</span> <span m='1259000'>hangs around for the next couple million years.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1262000'>And while it hangs around, there will be random mutations,</span>
  <span m='1266000'>which strike the genomes of individual members of that species.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1270000'>And therefore, the longer the life of the species</span>
  <span m='1274000'>as a whole, the more genetically diverse will become the individuals</span>
  <span m='1278000'>in the species, and therefore, this species will</span> <span
  m='1282000'>grow to have more and more genetic diversity, just because of the</span>
  <span m='1286000'>random stochastic mutations that accumulate in different peoples</span>
  <span m='1290000'>genomes in the course of the life of this species, over millions
  of years.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>Again, keep in mind that the vast majority
  of these accumulated</span> <span m='1298000'>mutations will be mutual mutations,
  which will not affect phenotype, and</span> <span m='1302000'>therefore, they will
  not be eliminated by Darwinian selection.</span> </p><p><span m='1306000'>And many
  of these neutral mutations, which have no effect on organismic</span> <span m='1310000'>fitness,
  but are simply evolutionary neutral, are sometimes called</span> <span m='1314000'>polymorphisms.
  The term polymorphism,</span> <span m='1319000'>-morph is once again morphology,
  derives from the fact that species</span> <span m='1323000'>tend to be polymorphic,
  we don't all have blond hair,</span> <span m='1327000'>we don't all have brown eyes.
  We, as a species,</span> <span m='1331000'>have a great variability in phenotype,
  we're polymorphic,</span> <span m='1335000'>and yet having black hair, and having
  blond hair,</span> <span m='1338000'>and having red hair, none of those is considered
  mutant,</span> <span m='1342000'>none of those is considered pathological. I.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1345000'>., among the group of normal phenotypes, there's a whole
  series</span> <span m='1349000'>of different gradations, and these are considered
  normal</span> <span m='1352000'>gradations in phenotype, but at the genetic level,</span>
  <span m='1356000'>we talk about polymorphisms in the same sense.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1360000'>Genetically distinct nucleotide sequences, which again,</span> <span
  m='1363000'>are not pathological, they don't create a disadvantageous phenotype.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1367000'>And as a consequence, they are once again, not selected
  against.</span> </p><p><span m='1371000'>Now look what happens over here. Here we
  have great genetic</span> <span m='1374000'>diversity, but what will happen is,
  for one reason or another, only a</span> <span m='1378000'>small subset of individuals
  constituting this species,</span> <span m='1382000'>will turn out to be the ancestors
  of the successor species.</span> </p><p><span m='1386000'>Here's the next species
  that arises. And why will these just be the</span> <span m='1389000'>ancestors?
  Well, everybody else could get killed off</span> <span m='1393000'>through some
  plague, they might get killed off by</span> <span m='1396000'>somebody going out
  and purposefully killing them, or,</span> <span m='1400000'>it might just be that
  a meteor comes down and wipes all these guys out,</span> <span m='1403000'>and these
  are the only ones in here, from this small subset of the</span> <span m='1407000'>original
  species, who end up surviving,</span> <span m='1411000'>and who end up becoming
  the precursors, the ancestors,</span> <span m='1414000'>of the new species, and
  once again, undergoes a period of</span> <span m='1418000'>diversification. And
  what we have therefore,</span> <span m='1422000'>is a diversification and then a
  collapse of genetic diversity.</span> </p><p><span m='1426000'>Here, this species,
  because it came from a small group,</span> <span m='1430000'>is initially rather,
  rather homogenous genetically,</span> <span m='1434000'>but with the passage of
  evolutionary time, once again,</span> <span m='1439000'>there's evolutionary diversification.
  So, an older species actually ends</span> <span m='1443000'>up being much more genetically
  diverse than does the</span> <span m='1447000'>younger species. If you look at two
  chimpanzees</span> <span m='1452000'>living on opposite sides of the same hill in
  West Africa,</span> <span m='1456000'>they are genetically far more distantly related
  to one another,</span> <span m='1460000'>than any one of us, by a factor of 10 to
  15. Two chimpanzees,</span> <span m='1464000'>they look exactly the same, they have
  the same peculiar habits,</span> <span m='1468000'>but they're genetically far more
  distantly-related than we are to</span> <span m='1472000'>one-another, than I am
  to any one of you, or than any one of you is to</span> <span m='1476000'>one another.
  And what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='1480000'>It means that, roughly
  speaking,</span> <span m='1485000'>the species of chimpanzees is, at least, 10 or
  15 times older than</span> <span m='1490000'>our species are. We're a young species,</span>
  <span m='1496000'>chimpanzees probably first speciated three or four million years
  ago,</span> <span m='1501000'>if the paleontological record is, is accurate. Paleontology
  is the</span> <span m='1507000'>study of old, dusty bones, so you can begin to imagine
  when</span> <span m='1512000'>chimpanzee bones become recognizable in the earth.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1518000'>So a paleontologist says that, that chimps aren't that
  old, and it</span> <span m='1522000'>begins to suggest that our species is only
  about 200,</span> <span m='1527000'>00 years old, at the oldest. Now you say 200,000
  years is a long</span> <span m='1532000'>time, but it isn't so long because I started
  out this discussion talking</span> <span m='1536000'>about 3.5 billion years, 3.5
  times ten to the ninth,</span> <span m='1541000'>and now I'm talking about two times
  ten to the fourth.</span> </p><p><span m='1546000'>Is that right? No, two times
  ten to the fifth.</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>Four orders of magnitude difference.
  So that means that our species, we</span> <span m='1555000'>went through a bottleneck
  about 200-250,000 years ago,</span> <span m='1559000'>and because that is so recent,
  we haven't had a chance to actually</span> <span m='1564000'>acquire much genetic
  diversity. We're actually very closely related</span> <span m='1568000'>to one another,
  although to talk to people,</span> <span m='1572000'>you'd think we were all very
  distantly related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='1577000'>Here's another
  interesting notion, which also figures in, and that is,</span> <span m='1581000'>what
  happens in the genetics of small populations?</span> </p><p><span m='1586000'>So
  here we started out with eight individuals, and let's assume for a</span> <span
  m='1590000'>moment, that this population has a steady size, i.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1594000'>. it doesn't increase or decrease over the course of several</span>
  <span m='1598000'>generations. And what that means is that each couple will,</span>
  <span m='1602000'>on average, leave behind two children, and those two children</span>
  <span m='1606000'>will breed, and each of them will, couples in the successor population,</span>
  <span m='1610000'>will leave behind two children. And what you see already,</span>
  <span m='1614000'>in such small populations, is that for example, this male here</span>
  <span m='1618000'>has two girls, and right away,</span> <span m='1622000'>to the
  extent he had an interesting y-chromosome, that y-chromosome was</span> <span m='1626000'>lost
  from the gene pool. This girl, here, had an interesting</span> <span m='1630000'>mitochondrial
  DNA, but right away that's lost,</span> <span m='1634000'>because she has, she has
  just two boys. And what you see,</span> <span m='1638000'>in very rapid order, in
  small populations, there's a</span> <span m='1642000'>homogenization of the genetic
  compliment, just because the alleles</span> <span m='1646000'>are lost within what's
  called, genetic drift.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>And as a consequence, very
  rapidly, there becomes</span> <span m='1654000'>homozygosity at many loci in very
  small populations.</span> </p><p><span m='1658000'>A real-life situation comes from
  Mutiny on the Bounty,</span> <span m='1662000'>where Fletcher Christian ends up
  getting shipwrecked on,</span> <span m='1666000'>what island was it, Pitcairn Island,
  which is somewhere on the South</span> <span m='1670000'>Pacific, South Atlantic,
  I forget where. Anyhow, today if</span> <span m='1674000'>you go to Pitcairn Island,
  almost everybody is called,</span> <span m='1678000'>almost everybody has a family
  name, Christian.</span> </p><p><span m='1682000'>Why? Was it that he was more studly
  and fecund than everybody else?</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>Probably not. What
  probably happened was, in the same dynamics</span> <span m='1688000'>that dictates
  the homogenization of y-chromosomes,</span> <span m='1692000'>dictates the homogenization
  of family names. So,</span> <span m='1695000'>if you isolate people in a small demographic
  isolate,</span> <span m='1698000'>like an island in the middle of the ocean, over
  a period of generations,</span> <span m='1702000'>roughly equal to, I think, twice
  the number of individuals in the steady,</span> <span m='1705000'>state population,
  everybody will have the same family name,</span> <span m='1708000'>because the other
  family names will, by chance, in a small population,</span> <span m='1712000'>just
  be lost. On my father's side of the family,</span> <span m='1716000'>I have hundreds
  of cousins with my family name, and on my mother's side</span> <span m='1720000'>of
  the family, not a single one,</span> <span m='1724000'>just as an example of this
  kind of trait. Now keep in mind that this</span> <span m='1728000'>evolutionary
  diversification can also affect the y-chromosome,</span> <span m='1732000'>so therefore,
  there are different y-chromosomes across the face of the</span> <span m='1736000'>planet,
  which can be distinguished, not because they're better or lesser</span> <span m='1740000'>y-chromosomes,
  in terms of the phenotype of</span> <span m='1744000'>maleness, but because they've
  accumulated polymorphisms</span> <span m='1748000'>over a period of time. They may
  be single-nucleotide</span> <span m='1752000'>polymorphisms, but these single-nucleotide</span>
  <span m='1756000'>polymorphisms can be used to determine how closely,</span> <span
  m='1760000'>or distantly related, are individuals to one another.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1764000'>Let's look at the mitochondrial DNA of women in western Europe,</span>
  <span m='1768000'>and if you look at the mitochondrial DNA of women in western Europe,</span>
  <span m='1773000'>you find that they only have, how many different things there?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1777000'>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, there's seven
  basic</span> <span m='1781000'>types of mitochondrial DNA that are found in western
  and northern</span> <span m='1785000'>European women. And what that means is,</span>
  <span m='1790000'>inescapably, people who live in modern-day Europe,</span> <span
  m='1795000'>descend from seven women who had these respective mitochondrial DNA</span>
  <span m='1800000'>sequences. When did those seven ancestors live,</span> <span m='1805000'>well
  we don't really know, probably between 10-15,000 years ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1810000'>But, the western-European population descends from an</span> <span m='1815000'>stunningly
  small number of founders.</span> </p><p><span m='1820000'>Now clearly, DNA sequencing
  is terrific, but it's not good enough</span> <span m='1822000'>to know the names
  of those women, so I can tell you that they were not</span> <span m='1825000'>named
  Velda and Jasmine. [LAUGHTER] Anyhow, but here you</span> <span m='1827000'>can
  see, here you can, now obviously, these women in turn</span> <span m='1830000'>were
  related to one another, you can ask, you can do another kind</span> <span m='1832000'>of
  question. How much are all of our mitochondrial DNA are related to</span> <span
  m='1835000'>one another, how distantly related are they to one another,</span> <span
  m='1837000'>given the rate of evolution of mitochondrial DNA sequences?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1840000'>And if you ask that question, the answer is that we all had a</span>
  <span m='1845000'>common ancestress who lived about 150,000 years ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1851000'>All of us trace our mitochondrial DNA to her. Does that mean that</span>
  <span m='1857000'>there was only one woman alive there, she's called, Mitochondrial-Eve,</span>
  <span m='1862000'>again, we don't know her name. Does that mean there was only one
  woman</span> <span m='1868000'>alive, well it doesn't mean that at all because of
  what I just told you,</span> <span m='1874000'>in small populations the proto-human
  population.</span> </p><p><span m='1880000'>I just told you that certain polymorphisms
  die out because of</span> <span m='1884000'>this genetic drift, because of these
  stochastic events.</span> </p><p><span m='1888000'>And so, the founding human population
  could have had 20,</span> <span m='1892000'>50,100 individuals in it, but one woman's
  mitochondrial DNA happened</span> <span m='1896000'>because of these accidents to
  dominate, so that now,</span> <span m='1901000'>all of us have the same, are the
  descendents of her</span> <span m='1905000'>mitochondrial DNA. Clearly, in the intervening
  time</span> <span m='1909000'>since 150,000 years ago, accumulated mutations have,</span>
  <span m='1913000'>have altered subtly the mitochondrial DNA genome,</span> <span
  m='1917000'>so there's polymorphisms, And so one can make,</span> <span m='1922000'>one
  can drive phylogenies of different kinds of mitochondrial DNA,</span> <span m='1928000'>and
  look at the relatedness between different clades,</span> <span m='1933000'>different
  groups, of women in modern-day Europe.</span> </p><p><span m='1939000'>70% of Finish
  men, in Finland, have a y-chromosome</span> <span m='1944000'>polymorphism that
  is otherwise virtually unheard of in the rest of</span> <span m='1950000'>Europe.
  70% of Finish men, now what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>Well,
  to me to means that those 70% of Finish men descended from a</span> <span m='1958000'>common
  ancestor, a male who lived around,</span> <span m='1961000'>if you look at the sequences,
  who lived around two or three</span> <span m='1964000'>thousand years ago, and who,
  for some reason,</span> <span m='1967000'>became the ancestor of all the people
  living in modern Finland.</span> </p><p><span m='1970000'>That's extraordinary.
  There's four million people living in Finland</span> <span m='1972000'>today, and
  the males all have their inherit, inherit their y-chromosome</span> <span m='1975000'>from
  that man, we don't know exactly where he lived,</span> <span m='1978000'>But obviously
  the modern Finish</span> <span m='1981000'>population descends from a very small
  founder-group who came into</span> <span m='1985000'>what we call, modern Finland,
  relatively recently, maybe two-two</span> <span m='1989000'>and a half thousand
  years ago, and thereafter, did not freely</span> <span m='1993000'>interbreed with
  the rest of the European population.</span> </p><p><span m='1996000'>How do we know
  that? Because that y-chromosomal</span> <span m='2000000'>polymorphism is not present
  elsewhere, it's only present in</span> <span m='2004000'>Finland. So it was a genetic,
  and obviously linguistic, isolate.</span> </p><p><span m='2008000'>So where do we
  all come from,</span> <span m='2012000'>all of us human beings? How closely related
  are we to one another?</span> </p><p><span m='2016000'>Here's, here's a measurement
  of the distances between different</span> <span m='2020000'>mitochondrial DNA's
  from different branches of humanity.</span> </p><p><span m='2024000'>And what you
  see is something really quite extraordinary and</span> <span m='2029000'>stunning.
  Here, you'll see that the people,</span> <span m='2033000'>the non-African lineages
  here and here, are actually relatively</span> <span m='2037000'>closely related
  to one another. But if you look at the people who</span> <span m='2041000'>live
  in Africa, down here, there is enormous genetic</span> <span m='2044000'>diversity.
  Look how far these evolutionary branches reach back,</span> <span m='2048000'>look
  how long these are. The distance of these branches,</span> <span m='2051000'>of
  these roots, determines how far, how distantly related these</span> <span m='2054000'>individuals
  are, one to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2058000'>And on the basis of that,
  and on the basis of a lot of other</span> <span m='2061000'>auxiliary genetic information,
  we can conclude that Africa was the</span> <span m='2064000'>site where genetic
  diversification was generated during</span> <span m='2068000'>human evolution. And
  that what happened,</span> <span m='2071000'>as a consequence of that diversification,</span>
  <span m='2075000'>is starting over the last 40, 50, 60,000 years ago, different</span>
  <span m='2079000'>populations, different sub-populations,</span> <span m='2082000'>small,
  isolated sub-populations, migrated out of Africa, took a very</span> <span m='2086000'>small
  sub-set of the polymorphisms with them, and became the</span> <span m='2089000'>founder-populations
  of a whole variety of whole different</span> <span m='2093000'>modern-day populations.
  These populations here are largely</span> <span m='2097000'>Mongoloid, these populations
  here are largely Caucasian,</span> <span m='2100000'>and here, we see that in Africa
  there's enormous genetic</span> <span m='2104000'>diversity. And by the way,</span>
  <span m='2107000'>all the genes that are present here, the alleles that are present
  here,</span> <span m='2111000'>can also be found in Africa, but in relatively small
  proportions</span> <span m='2115000'>in Africa. And we know this kind of diversity
  exists both for the</span> <span m='2119000'>mitochondrial DNA, and here's for the
  y-chromosomal DNA,</span> <span m='2123000'>again, we look for polymorphisms. And
  this is not a very good</span> <span m='2126000'>overhead, again, the reproduction
  was not very good,</span> <span m='2130000'>but what I'm showing you is that the
  evolutionary, the depth of these</span> <span m='2134000'>evolutionary branches
  is enormous in Africa, yet in other parts of the</span> <span m='2138000'>globe,
  people are much more closely-related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>Some
  people argue on the basis of the genetic-relatedness of western</span> <span m='2145000'>and
  northern Europeans, that the modern European population</span> <span m='2148000'>is
  largely descended from about 20 couples that moved into Europe about</span> <span
  m='2152000'>10,000 years ago, eight to ten thousand years ago,</span> <span m='2155000'>at
  the time when agriculture was introduced into Europe from the</span> <span m='2158000'>middle
  east, just on the basis of looking at these y-chromosomal</span> <span m='2162000'>sequences.
  And so, we human beings arose,</span> <span m='2166000'>even though we are reasonably
  distantly related to one another on</span> <span m='2171000'>this graph, keep in
  mind that we as a species, are enormously close to</span> <span m='2176000'>one
  another because of the youth of this, of our species.</span> </p><p><span m='2181000'>If
  you look at our, the time of this diversification was probably</span> <span m='2186000'>sometime
  between 80-100, 00 years ago, so how did it all</span> <span m='2191000'>happen?
  We can even figure out the history of humanity by beginning to</span> <span m='2196000'>look
  at these different kinds of polymorphisms.</span> </p><p><span m='2202000'>A long
  time ago, individuals went out from Africa,</span> <span m='2205000'>maybe starting
  100,000 years ago, maybe starting more recently,</span> <span m='2209000'>and went
  across the southern rim of Eurasia, and we know already,</span> <span m='2213000'>we
  find archeological remains of Aborigines in Australia between</span> <span m='2216000'>40-60,000
  years ago. And by the way, those people are</span> <span m='2220000'>very distantly
  related to the rest of us, having left and not</span> <span m='2224000'>intermingled
  with the rest of humanity for a very long</span> <span m='2228000'>period of time.
  There were Aborigines in Australia,</span> <span m='2231000'>already at a time when
  our ancestors, to the extent we had ancestors in</span> <span m='2235000'>Europe,
  were still battling the Neanderthals, who only died out 30,</span> <span m='2239000'>00
  years ago. You may know by the way, you may have read in the</span> <span m='2243000'>newspaper,
  about a month ago, they discovered skeletons of very</span> <span m='2247000'>small
  people on an island Indonesia. In fact, those were probably not</span> <span m='2250000'>even
  homosapiens, those were probably a precursor</span> <span m='2254000'>species, because
  we know over the last two million years,</span> <span m='2258000'>there have been
  hominoids, look like human beings but are</span> <span m='2262000'>precursors, who
  might migrated out of Africa, who dispersed throughout</span> <span m='2266000'>Asia,
  and who eventually became extinct,</span> <span m='2270000'>So that the only modern
  human who exist are the descendents of this</span> <span m='2273000'>out migration
  that began about 100, 00 years ago. We know that about 15,</span> <span m='2277000'>00
  years ago some of these people ended up going over here,</span> <span m='2280000'>to
  crossing in four different waves of migration, you can see it from</span> <span
  m='2284000'>the DNA, into the western hemisphere.</span> </p><p><span m='2288000'>Amerindians,
  that is, American Indians, Native Americans,</span> <span m='2292000'>are genetically
  rather homogenous. Why? Because they all descend from</span> <span m='2296000'>very
  small founder populations that came into the western hemisphere</span> <span m='2301000'>relatively
  recently. And there's enormous genetic</span> <span m='2305000'>homogeneity among
  different subgroups of individuals here in</span> <span m='2310000'>South America.
  Speaking of South America,</span> <span m='2314000'>if you look in some parts of
  Venezuela, what you find is that the</span> <span m='2319000'>mitochondrial DNA
  is largely of Indian-origin,</span> <span m='2323000'>but the y-chromosomal DNA
  is largely of European origin.</span> </p><p><span m='2328000'>So, what happens
  there, that's a testimonial to the tragic</span> <span m='2332000'>fate of the Indians,
  where the conquistadors from Spain</span> <span m='2336000'>came in, killed all
  the men, and took all the women, to be their</span> <span m='2340000'>brides. How
  else can you explain the fact that there's no Indian</span> <span m='2344000'>y-chromosomes,
  there's all, there is instead only</span> <span m='2348000'>European y-chromosomes.
  And here you can begin to see what</span> <span m='2352000'>happened here in New
  York, as well. 40,000 years ago people</span> <span m='2356000'>started trickling
  into Europe, and they hung around there for the</span> <span m='2361000'>next 30,000
  years, pretty much on their own.</span> </p><p><span m='2366000'>The remnants of
  those people who came in, we know from DNA,</span> <span m='2370000'>are the Basques
  who live in northern Spain, who speak,</span> <span m='2375000'>by the way, a non-indo
  European language.</span> </p><p><span m='2380000'>They're the relics of this initial
  settlement by modern humans of</span> <span m='2383000'>Europe, starting 40, 00
  years ago. And they had the</span> <span m='2387000'>continent for themselves for
  the next 30,000 years,</span> <span m='2390000'>until this new founder population
  came in, about 10,</span> <span m='2394000'>00 years ago. Here's the names of the
  girls who were in that group,</span> <span m='2397000'>Ursula and Katrine and Zenya,
  Tara, Jasmine, and Velda, and they became</span> <span m='2401000'>the modern agriculturalists,
  and swamped out the people who were</span> <span m='2404000'>there 40,000 years
  ago, who now only survive as a relic</span> <span m='2408000'>population. Here's
  a fun story I like to tell</span> <span m='2412000'>each year, and it's about the
  Cohen and y-chromosome,</span> <span m='2416000'>and you'll see what an amusing
  story this is, just from genetics.</span> </p><p><span m='2421000'>Now the name
  Cohen, in Hebrew means, a high priest,</span> <span m='2425000'>and you've heard
  people named Cohen, it's not such an uncommon name among</span> <span m='2429000'>the
  Jews. And it says, in the Bible, in Genesis and Exodus,</span> <span m='2434000'>that
  all the high priests in the Bible are the descendents of Aaron,</span> <span m='2438000'>the
  brother of Moses. And it's also been the practice for</span> <span m='2443000'>the
  last 3,000 years, that the only person who can become,</span> <span m='2447000'>the
  only male who can become a Cohen, is the son of a Cohen.</span> </p><p><span m='2451000'>In
  other words, you cannot be adopted into a family and acquire</span> <span m='2456000'>the
  name Cohen. And if that's all true,</span> <span m='2460000'>and if the Bible is
  true, and Aaron lived 3,000 years ago,</span> <span m='2465000'>whatever his name
  was, then it should be the case that all male</span> <span m='2469000'>Cohen's should
  have the same y-chromosome, right?</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>Because they
  all descend, their family name is Cohen,</span> <span m='2477000'>they could only
  get it from their father, they could only get their</span> <span m='2481000'>y-chromosome
  from their father, so they should all have the same</span> <span m='2485000'>y-chromosome.
  Of course, you say that can't really be the</span> <span m='2489000'>case, because
  we know in this country, in this country,</span> <span m='2492000'>between five
  and ten percent of people, on average,</span> <span m='2496000'>are sending Father's
  Day cards to the wrong person.</span> </p><p><span m='2500000'>What does that mean?
  Non-paternity.</span> </p><p><span m='2504000'>When you do genetic counseling of
  family these days,</span> <span m='2508000'>one of the strictures is, that you never
  tell the family if</span> <span m='2513000'>the children have genetic polymorphisms
  that don't match that</span> <span m='2517000'>of the person whom they think is
  their father. They don't look like</span> <span m='2522000'>their, the person whom
  they regard as father, but that's always assumed</span> <span m='2526000'>to be
  a role of the genetic dice. So, how is that relevant? Well,</span> <span m='2531000'>let's
  talk about this descent from Aaron, who lived 3,000 years ago.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2536000'>We're talking about the y-chromosome being passed from one generation
  to</span> <span m='2540000'>the next, just like the family name. So what happened,
  what would happen</span> <span m='2544000'>if sometime over the last 3, 00 years,
  Mrs. Cohen had a dalliance,</span> <span m='2549000'>had an affair, with a television
  repairman,</span> <span m='2553000'>or the milkman, or the mailman, and never told
  Mr. Cohen? The</span> <span m='2557000'>y-chromosome, which her son thought he was
  getting from Dad,</span> <span m='2562000'>wouldn't be coming from Dad, it'd be
  coming from this other,</span> <span m='2566000'>the milkman or the mailman, and
  it wouldn't be a Cohen-y chromosome</span> <span m='2571000'>unless, by chance,
  the mailman or the milkman also</span> <span m='2575000'>happened to be a Cohen,
  [LAUGHTER], it could happen.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>But the chances are,
  roughly speaking, Cohen's are only</span> <span m='2584000'>four percent of all
  Jews, so the chances are against that</span> <span m='2588000'>happening. OK, so
  they did this experiment,</span> <span m='2592000'>and this is really astounding
  experiment. They went,</span> <span m='2596000'>the story is they went to a beach
  in Tel Aviv, I don't know whether they</span> <span m='2600000'>actually did that
  or not, and they picked up, they picked up</span> <span m='2604000'>100 male Cohen's
  who were Ashkenazi , Ashkenazi means their ancestors came</span> <span m='2608000'>from
  central Europe, over here. And they picked up 100 Sefardi</span> <span m='2612000'>Cohen's,
  and the Sefardi Cohen's come from Spain,</span> <span m='2616000'>North Africa,
  Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Uzbekistan,</span> <span m='2620000'>Central Asia. And
  the last time that the Iraqi Cohen's and the</span> <span m='2624000'>Ashkenazi
  Cohen's were interbreeding, were about 500 BC,</span> <span m='2628000'>at the time
  of the Babylonian XL, so they've been apart a long time.</span> </p><p><span m='2632000'>And
  they looked at their y-chromosomes,</span> <span m='2636000'>and what they found
  was that 70% of the y-chromosomes of these male</span> <span m='2640000'>Cohen's,
  70% of the Cohen's shared the same y-chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='2644000'>Well,
  the same y-chromosome was present only in 15% of non-Cohen,</span> <span m='2647000'>Israeli
  Jews. Now think about that for a second. 70% of these men had</span> <span m='2651000'>the
  same y-chromosome, of course they didn't know they had</span> <span m='2654000'>the
  same y-chromosome, all they knew was that they had the</span> <span m='2658000'>same
  family name. And what that means,</span> <span m='2662000'>inescapably, is that
  over a period of two or three thousand years,</span> <span m='2665000'>it was hard
  to trace with exactitude when the common male ancestor lived,</span> <span m='2669000'>over
  a period of two or three thousand years,</span> <span m='2672000'>somehow the milkman
  and the mailman stayed away from Mrs.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>Cohen, or
  Mrs. Cohen was unusually virtuous.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>Because keep
  in mind, any single affair with the milkman</span> <span m='2683000'>or the mailman,
  over 3,000 years,</span> <span m='2687000'>would've broke this chain of inheritance,
  any single incidence of</span> <span m='2690000'>non-paternity. It's a really astounding
  story,</span> <span m='2694000'>and it's hard, there can be no artifact to it,</span>
  <span m='2697000'>there's no bias in it, there's no other way to explain it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2701000'>And you can begin to find similar stories of families in
  England,</span> <span m='2704000'>where males are tenth cousins of one another,
  they have the same family</span> <span m='2708000'>name, and they also have the
  same y-chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='2712000'>The most amusing commentary on
  this stems from a tribe that lives in</span> <span m='2717000'>southern Africa,
  and these people are called,</span> <span m='2722000'>Lemba, L-e-m-b-a. And the,
  the myth of the Lemba is that they descend</span> <span m='2727000'>from Jews who
  came down from the north, Jewish traitors.</span> </p><p><span m='2732000'>So just
  for the hell of it, some geneticists went down and drew</span> <span m='2737000'>blood
  from the male Lembas, and there's four casts of Lembas,</span> <span m='2742000'>there's
  the ruling class, there's the warriors, there's the farmers,</span> <span m='2747000'>the
  merchants, I don't know. And what they found was that all</span> <span m='2751000'>members
  of the, almost all members of the ruling</span> <span m='2755000'>cast among the
  Lembas, had the same y-chromosome,</span> <span m='2759000'>and the y-chromosome
  had exactly the same polymorphisms of the Cohen</span> <span m='2762000'>y-chromosome.
  No one in the other, no males in the other three casts</span> <span m='2766000'>had,
  or very few, had otherwise this y-chromosomal</span> <span m='2770000'>polymorphism.
  Go figure, I don't know what's going on.</span> </p><p><span m='2774000'>Now did
  those people look Jewish? Well, they looked like everybody</span> <span m='2777000'>else
  around them, because if there was a Mr.</span> </p><p><span m='2780000'>Cohen who
  came down there, three or four hundred years ago,</span> <span m='2783000'>and married
  in, he obviously married one of the local population.</span> </p><p><span m='2787000'>And
  there were no other people around from, coming in from the</span> <span m='2790000'>north,
  to marry to, so that 99% of the males in this</span> <span m='2793000'>ruling cast,
  who have the Cohen y-chromosome, 99% of their genes</span> <span m='2797000'>come
  from the local population, the only thing they inherited from</span> <span m='2800000'>Mr.
  Cohen was the y-chromosome. Where else would they get their</span> <span m='2804000'>genes?
  There wasn't a massive migration from the middle east down</span> <span m='2808000'>to
  the Lemba tribes, probably just one man came down</span> <span m='2812000'>selling
  trinkets, or who-knows-what,</span> <span m='2816000'>television sets, or VCRs,
  sometime over the last three or four</span> <span m='2820000'>hundred years. And
  somehow, for reasons that we</span> <span m='2824000'>have no idea, he became the
  ancestor of this cast of people in this tribe</span> <span m='2828000'>in the middle
  of Africa. And so you have stories that you</span> <span m='2832000'>begin to pick
  up, which are stranger than fiction,</span> <span m='2836000'>some of the weirdest
  stories that you've ever heard of in your life.</span> </p><p><span m='2840000'>Imagine
  having 3,000 years of uninterrupted transmission from,</span> <span m='2844000'>without
  a single case of non-paternity.</span> </p><p><span m='2848000'>It didn't happen
  all the cases, because I didn't say 100% of the</span> <span m='2852000'>Cohen men
  had it, on 30% of the occasions,</span> <span m='2856000'>there must have been some
  snipping of this chain of transmission.</span> </p><p><span m='2860000'>And keep
  in mind that this chain of transmission happened over a period</span> <span m='2872000'>of
  enormous political and upheaval, over the last 3,000 years. The</span> <span m='2884000'>middle
  east, and Europe, and North Africa, have not been</span> <span m='2897000'>tranquil
