title: 'Lecture 29: Stem Cells/Cloning 1'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning, class. Nice to see you here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='4000'>Yesterday morning I was in Australia and today I'm here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='9000'>And it's nice to be back. It's a long way home.</span> </p><p><span m='14000'>We're
  talking today about the issues of growth and differentiation</span> <span m='19000'>about
  normal cells becoming specialized into different types of</span> <span m='23000'>cells
  throughout the body and how that leads ultimately to the issues</span> <span m='28000'>of
  organismic cloning. And, to give you an overall</span> <span m='33000'>background
  about this, I want to show you the way that a</span> <span m='37000'>worm is put
  together. This is the worm C. elegans.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>I don't know
  how well this overhead will come out.</span> </p><p><span m='46000'>You can see
  it reasonably well. So, this is the worm Caenorhabditis</span> <span m='50000'>elegans.
  It's been an object of much study here.</span> </p><p><span m='55000'>Bob Horowitz
  in our own department just got the Nobel Prize</span> <span m='59000'>for his work
  on this.</span> </p><p><span m='67000'>And the reason it's been the object of so
  much study is,</span> <span m='71000'>in fact, that it's a relatively simple organism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='76000'>It's the way that you and I looked about 600 million years
  ago when</span> <span m='80000'>Metazoa, remember Metazoa means multicellular organisms,</span>
  <span m='85000'>first arose on the face of the planet. Let's see if I have too</span>
  <span m='89000'>much overlap here. Well, that's about the way it should</span> <span
  m='94000'>look. Now, what's remarkable about this organism is it has something</span>
  <span m='98000'>like 965 cells in the adult. The cells all descend from a</span>
  <span m='102000'>fertilized egg. It happens to be that this worm is</span> <span
  m='107000'>a hermaphrodite. So, you probably know</span> <span m='111000'>hermaphrodites
  are both male and female and it can fertilize itself</span> <span m='115000'>or
  two worms can get together and fertilize each other.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>Because,
  as you can see, it makes both eggs and it makes</span> <span m='124000'>sperm. And
  what's most interesting is the finite number of cells in the</span> <span m='128000'>body
  of the adult. As I said, it's 965,</span> <span m='133000'>whose lineage can be
  traced through a pedigree that's given right up</span> <span m='137000'>here. So,
  one can plot out, with great precision, how all the</span> <span m='142000'>cells,
  how the egg cell and the fertilized egg divides in two,</span> <span m='146000'>each
  of those cells divides again in two and how ultimately one has a</span> <span m='151000'>whole
  series of different descendents from different branches</span> <span m='155000'>of
  this very elaborate family tree. Now, one of the issues that we want</span> <span
  m='160000'>to pursue is the fact that the genomes, in principle,</span> <span m='164000'>all
  the cells in this organism are the same. That is to say whenever</span> <span m='168000'>the
  cell goes through a cycle of growth and division the cell is</span> <span m='172000'>genetically
  identical, yet phenotypically, yet the behavior</span> <span m='176000'>reach of
  these cells becomes increasingly different.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>And here
  you can see the different lineage of cells.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>This
  organism devotes a disproportionately large amount of</span> <span m='188000'>its
  anatomy to reproduction, much more even than we do. Here,</span> <span m='192000'>this
  is the cuticle, the outer coat. Here's the vulva, the female organ.</span> </p><p><span
  m='196000'>This is the male organ and a variety of other cells types.</span> </p><p><span
  m='200000'>Here's the pharynx. And yet all the cells in all these organisms,</span>
  <span m='204000'>with the exception of the gametes, remember gametes means sperm
  and egg</span> <span m='208000'>are genetically identical. The gametes have only
  half the</span> <span m='213000'>genetic content. Everybody else is identical,</span>
  <span m='217000'>has a diploid genome, that is to say two copies of each gene.</span>
  </p><p><span m='222000'>And one can trace this all out. And this represents one
  of the</span> <span m='226000'>great mysteries of developmental biology, which is
  to say how are</span> <span m='230000'>cells that genetically identical to one another
  genotypically identical</span> <span m='235000'>to one another, phenotypically quite
  different one</span> <span m='239000'>from the other? What makes them so different?</span>
  </p><p><span m='244000'>In fact, this image that we have here, which in itself represents
  a</span> <span m='248000'>stunning achievement, that is being able to trace the</span>
  <span m='253000'>pedigree of each cell in the adult body is very different from
  our own</span> <span m='258000'>lineage because, as I may have mentioned to you
  in</span> <span m='262000'>the past, each of us goes through ten to the sixth mitoses
  in a</span> <span m='267000'>lifetime, you and I. That's ten to the sixteen cell</span>
  <span m='272000'>divisions. And at any one time we have roughly three times ten
  to the</span> <span m='276000'>thirteenth cells in our body. So, that means, if
  you think about</span> <span m='280000'>that carefully, the ratio between these
  two suggests</span> <span m='284000'>there's roughly a hundred times more here than
  here,</span> <span m='288000'>three hundred times more It means, roughly speaking,
  that our body</span> <span m='292000'>turns over roughly a hundred times in our
  lifetime.</span> </p><p><span m='296000'>That is to say the cells turnover. Not
  all of the cells,</span> <span m='299000'>but that there's a continuing replacement
  of existing cells with</span> <span m='303000'>new cells. After all, if, in fact,
  there were no such</span> <span m='306000'>replacement than we might, as an adult,
  be formed of this many</span> <span m='310000'>cells, and we would stay with the
  exact same number of cells</span> <span m='313000'>throughout our lives. But this,
  in fact, is the number of</span> <span m='317000'>cell divisions. And so, there's
  an enormous turnover</span> <span m='321000'>which, right away on its surface, independent
  of the fact that it's an</span> <span m='324000'>enormously large number, precludes
  one from really being able</span> <span m='328000'>to draw out a pedigree like this,
  prevents anyone from really</span> <span m='331000'>understanding how each particular
  cell can trace its line of decent</span> <span m='335000'>back to the fertilized
  egg. So, what we really want to explore,</span> <span m='339000'>in this lecture
  and the next one, is this major puzzle that one starts</span> <span m='344000'>out
  with a fertilized egg. Let's say this is a fertilized egg.</span> </p><p><span m='348000'>It
  divides in two. It divides in four. And through subsequent cycles</span> <span m='353000'>of
  growth and division we ultimately end up with the adult.</span> </p><p><span m='358000'>Already
  at the four-cell stage, here in a vertebrate embryo, these</span> <span m='363000'>cells
  have begun to take different phenotypic paths.</span> </p><p><span m='368000'>That
  is to say cells have begun to commit themselves into entering into</span> <span
  m='373000'>one or another differentiation lineage. And when I say a</span> <span
  m='378000'>differentiating lineage, I mean a group of cells which has</span> <span
  m='383000'>already made the decision to become blood cells, to become gut,</span>
  <span m='389000'>to become nerve cells and so forth. And these commitments already
  start</span> <span m='394000'>here at the four-cell stage, and they continue to
  play themselves</span> <span m='398000'>out until one reaches a newborn, and then
  thereafter one just grows</span> <span m='402000'>bigger. One other important thing
  to show here is that this pedigree</span> <span m='406000'>that I showed you here
  is not simply the result of exponential expansion</span> <span m='410000'>of all
  the cells, because many cells,</span> <span m='414000'>during the course of development,
  are actually weeded out from</span> <span m='418000'>embryonic tissue. And this
  happens even in our own</span> <span m='422000'>development. For example, here,
  if we look at our fingers,</span> <span m='427000'>I remember now I talked about
  fingers about two weeks ago and got</span> <span m='431000'>myself into some hot
  water. If we look at our fingers, you'll</span> <span m='436000'>see here we have
  five fingers, God willing, and but early in</span> <span m='441000'>embryogenesis
  our hand looks like a solid flap of tissue.</span> </p><p><span m='446000'>And what
  happens, during the course of vertebra development,</span> <span m='450000'>is that
  the tissue in between the beginning fingers is eliminated</span> <span m='455000'>through
  the process of apoptosis. Apoptosis means programmed cell</span> <span m='460000'>death.
  Apoptosis is equivalent to cell suicide. And what I mean by</span> <span m='466000'>that
  is to say that development involves not only the exponential</span> <span m='472000'>proliferation
  of cells but it involves the selective elimination</span> <span m='478000'>of cells
  here in a very obvious anatomical way.</span> </p><p><span m='484000'>It sometimes
  can be defective, in which case individuals are born</span> <span m='487000'>with
  large webs between their fingers. And this is part of normal</span> <span m='491000'>development.
  And the same can be said here. If there were no</span> <span m='495000'>apoptosis
  during the development of this worm embryo then there would be</span> <span m='498000'>vastly
  larger numbers of cells. We mentioned implicitly apoptosis</span> <span m='502000'>during
  the development of the immune system, because recall there that</span> <span m='506000'>bee
  cells, which are destine to produce antibodies,</span> <span m='509000'>if they
  produce inappropriate kinds of antibodies,</span> <span m='513000'>if they produce
  antibodies that are self-reactive,</span> <span m='517000'>i.e., recognize some
  of the body's own proteins, those cells are</span> <span m='521000'>eliminated by
  apoptosis. If they produce defective antibody</span> <span m='524000'>molecules,
  they're eliminated by apoptosis. And,</span> <span m='528000'>therefore, differentiation,
  which is what we're talking about</span> <span m='531000'>here, involves not only
  the commitment of cells to a certain</span> <span m='535000'>lineage, but the purpose
  of elimination of cells in certain</span> <span m='538000'>parts of the organism
  in order to carve and sculpt out properly</span> <span m='542000'>shaped tissue.
  Again, our fingers are one dramatic</span> <span m='545000'>example of that. It
  turns out we can learn an awful</span> <span m='549000'>lot about this process by
  studying one specialized adult tissue,</span> <span m='553000'>which is to say the
  organs of hematopoiesis.</span> </p><p><span m='557000'>And they'll teach us a lot
  about some of the lessons we need to learn</span> <span m='560000'>about organismic
  development and differentiation.</span> </p><p><span m='564000'>And when I use the
  word hematopoiesis,</span> <span m='568000'>the term hematopoiesis, or the adjective
  hematopoietic</span> <span m='572000'>refers to the creation, the formation of different
  kinds of</span> <span m='576000'>blood cells. In fact, we know that all the cells</span>
  <span m='580000'>in the blood descend in the organism from a common progenitor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='585000'>And this progenitor is called a pluripotent stem cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='590000'>Pluripotent means that this stem cell, and we'll define
  a stem cell</span> <span m='595000'>momentarily, this stem cell is able to create
  descendents which can</span> <span m='600000'>commit themselves in a number of distinct
  directions.</span> </p><p><span m='605000'>They can differentiate in a number of
  distinct directions.</span> </p><p><span m='609000'>In this case, we see all these
  various kinds of white and red blood</span> <span m='614000'>cells which descend
  from this pluripotent stem cell.</span> </p><p><span m='619000'>And, as a consequence,
  we call it pluripotent because it</span> <span m='624000'>has these multiple distinct
  types of differentiation lineages.</span> </p><p><span m='629000'>So, here we talk
  about pluripotent. Later on I'll talk about totipotent</span> <span m='634000'>cells.
  Totipotent are cells that can do everything.</span> </p><p><span m='638000'>Therefore,
  in fact, what's a totipotent cell?</span> </p><p><span m='642000'>Well, a cell in
  the early embryo, including a fertilized egg is</span> <span m='646000'>totipotent
  in that it can direct its descendents into all of the</span> <span m='650000'>differentiation
  lineages in the body. Here we have a cell that's already</span> <span m='654000'>more
  limited. It's only pluripotent, pluri in the sense of multiple</span> <span m='658000'>but
  not total. Totipotent obviously means it can do</span> <span m='663000'>everything.
  And here we see the different kinds of derivative white</span> <span m='667000'>blood
  cells that exists in the bone marrow and in the circulation,</span> <span m='671000'>and
  there's a whole series of different ones of them.</span> </p><p><span m='675000'>We'll
  talk about some of them shortly, but we've already</span> <span m='679000'>encountered
  some of them up here in the form of T cells and B cells.</span> </p><p><span m='683000'>When
  we use the word stem cell the essence of the definition</span> <span m='687000'>is
  as follows. A stem cell is a cell that can</span> <span m='693000'>self-renew and
  it can also have a differentiated daughter.</span> </p><p><span m='699000'>So, here's
  the way one can diagram a stem cell. Here's a stem cell</span> <span m='706000'>that
  has two daughter cells. One daughter cell is exactly like</span> <span m='713000'>Mom
  and the other daughter cell has undertaken a program of becoming</span> <span m='719000'>differentiated.
  So, here we have an asymmetric cell</span> <span m='724000'>division on the part
  of this stem cell up here.</span> </p><p><span m='728000'>We'll prove later on that
  these two</span> <span m='734000'>cells are genetically identical, but clearly they're
  reading out</span> <span m='738000'>their genes in quite different ways. This cell
  is absolutely the same as</span> <span m='741000'>the mother cell. This cell has
  already committed</span> <span m='744000'>itself. It's made the commitment to differentiate
  in one</span> <span m='748000'>or another lineage. And another way of noting this</span>
  <span m='752000'>graphically is the following. We can draw a picture like this,</span>
  <span m='756000'>as we did before, and here we'll have a second arrow that goes
  around</span> <span m='761000'>like this. It loops around back on itself, and that
  implies the whole</span> <span m='765000'>program of self-renewal. Now, the whole
  concept of</span> <span m='769000'>self-renewal is a simple one. If a stem cell
  can self-renew,</span> <span m='774000'>that implies that the process of growth
  and division does not deplete</span> <span m='778000'>the pool of stem cells in
  the body or in a particular tissue.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>So, let's imagine
  what we're looking at here. Here we have a stem cell.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>It
  has one cell that is just like Mom. This is a differentiated cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='793000'>Once again, you can have a growth and division. This is,</span> <span
  m='798000'>once again, a cell like Mom. This is a differentiated cell and</span>
  <span m='804000'>so forth. And what you notice here in this arrangement is that
  the stem</span> <span m='809000'>cells perpetuate themselves. They are self-renewing.</span>
  </p><p><span m='814000'>And, as a consequence, the pool of stem cells is never depleted
  in the</span> <span m='818000'>best of all possible worlds. It turns out that in
  most of the</span> <span m='822000'>tissues of our body there is self-renewing stem
  cells going on,</span> <span m='826000'>because most of the differentiated cells
  in our body have a finite</span> <span m='831000'>lifetime. Not all of them but
  most of them. And when I say finite,</span> <span m='835000'>I mean it can be measured
  in a matter of days or weeks</span> <span m='839000'>or months. In the case of the
  brain,</span> <span m='843000'>things turnover very slowly. Even in the case of
  our bones,</span> <span m='847000'>our bones actually turn over roughly once, 10%
  a year.</span> </p><p><span m='851000'>10% of the matter in the bone is actually
  turnover in every year.</span> </p><p><span m='855000'>So, almost all tissues in
  the body are in a process of continuing</span> <span m='859000'>self-renewal and
  repair. And that self-renewal and repair is</span> <span m='863000'>maintained by
  this stem cell compartment, as is indicated here.</span> </p><p><span m='867000'>This
  has certain kinds of great advantages, and one of the</span> <span m='872000'>advantages
  is indicated by the following. Let's imagine that we</span> <span m='878000'>draw
  a picture, just for the sake of argument,</span> <span m='883000'>of one of the
  most highly proliferative tissues in the body,</span> <span m='889000'>which is
  to say the lining of the colon or of the duodenum.</span> </p><p><span m='894000'>So,
  here we have, let me draw it slightly differently,</span> <span m='900000'>here's
  the way the lining of the small intestine looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='906000'>Out
  here are the contents of the small intestine.</span> </p><p><span m='910000'>So,
  let's say here is the lumen of</span> <span m='920000'>the small intestine. And
  here we have, protruding into</span> <span m='924000'>the lumen, when I talk about
  a lumen I'm talking about the bore or the</span> <span m='928000'>channel of a cylindrical
  or tube like organism.</span> </p><p><span m='932000'>So, here is the lumen of the
  small intestine. Here are these</span> <span m='936000'>fingerlike projections,
  they're called villi, that protrude</span> <span m='941000'>into the lumen of the
  small intestine. And down here at the</span> <span m='945000'>bottom of this are
  these cavities that are called crypts,</span> <span m='950000'>C-R-Y-P-T-S. These
  are the crypts. Now, what's important to realize is</span> <span m='954000'>that
  what goes through our intestines is not that pleasant.</span> </p><p><span m='959000'>It's
  pretty corrosive stuff. I probably told you this already,</span> <span m='963000'>more
  bacteria living in there than we have in our entire cells in our</span> <span m='967000'>entire
  body. There are all kinds of digestive juices.</span> </p><p><span m='971000'>And
  so the cells out here at the tips of these villi are continually</span> <span m='975000'>exposed
  to all kinds of corrosive material, including the junk that we</span> <span m='979000'>eat
  everyday which is flowing by like this. And this indicates how</span> <span m='983000'>critically
  important it is that we have self-renewal,</span> <span m='987000'>because the cells
  out here, being continually exposed to the</span> <span m='991000'>most corrosive
  kinds of influences, are rapidly damages.</span> </p><p><span m='995000'>And, therefore,
  the cells out here have a lifetime</span> <span m='999000'>of only three or four
  days and are then induced to jump off the end of</span> <span m='1004000'>a gangplank
  and commit apoptosis. So, the cells at the tip of the</span> <span m='1009000'>villis
  are continually jumping off and dying. And what's happening is</span> <span m='1014000'>that
  down here in the bottom of the crypts we have stem cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1019000'>The
  stem cells are continually</span> <span m='1026000'>producing progeny that have
  committed themselves to</span> <span m='1029000'>differentiate. And the progeny,</span>
  <span m='1033000'>as you might guess from what I've just said, are continually migrating</span>
  <span m='1036000'>up the sides of the villis up to the end here. And this whole
  migration</span> <span m='1039000'>takes four or five days, and by the time they
  get to the tip</span> <span m='1043000'>and have stuck their heads into the contents
  of the lumen of the</span> <span m='1046000'>intestine for that period of three
  or four days.</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>Finally, they're eliminated and they
  jump off into the abyss.</span> </p><p><span m='1053000'>So, there's a continuing
  action going on here.</span> </p><p><span m='1057000'>The stem cells are continually
  dividing. And what advantages does</span> <span m='1060000'>this have for us? Well,
  it means that cells that are</span> <span m='1064000'>damaged are not allowed to
  hang around for a very long period of</span> <span m='1067000'>time, i.e., cells
  up here in the top that are exposed to,</span> <span m='1071000'>for example, potential
  mutagenic influences are rapidly eliminated.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>Why
  is that good? Because the mutagenic influences up here could</span> <span m='1078000'>well
  create a mutant cell that, in principle, is able to become</span> <span m='1082000'>cancerous.
  And the body says,</span> <span m='1085000'>well, I don't mind if that happens because
  these cells up here are</span> <span m='1089000'>going to be eliminated anyhow.
  They're going to be pushed off the</span> <span m='1092000'>end of the diving board
  or the gangplank into the abyss,</span> <span m='1096000'>so they are continually
  undergoing apoptosis, not as a pathological</span> <span m='1099000'>process. As
  a normal process. They're continually being pushed</span> <span m='1103000'>out
  here. And what that means is that the</span> <span m='1107000'>cells down here,
  in the bottom of the crypt,</span> <span m='1111000'>are actually physically protected
  from the contents of the lumen of</span> <span m='1116000'>the small intestine because
  some of the cells in this crypt are</span> <span m='1121000'>continually secreting
  a kind of mucus in this area right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1125000'>It's called
  a mucin. And this mucin here creates a physical</span> <span m='1130000'>barrier,
  so the cells that are in the bottom of the crypt are never</span> <span m='1135000'>directly
  exposed to the contents of what's flowing by in the</span> <span m='1139000'>small
  intestine. And that is extremely important</span> <span m='1143000'>because, in
  fact, it means that these cells down here</span> <span m='1147000'>are shielded
  from the mutagenic influences of what might be present</span> <span m='1151000'>in
  the lumen of the small intestine. In theory, one might be able to</span> <span m='1155000'>evolve
  cells that don't mind being up here in the lumen of the small</span> <span m='1159000'>intestine.
  But, in fact, that's never been possible.</span> </p><p><span m='1163000'>That is
  to say evolution has just said, well, we can't really evolve</span> <span m='1167000'>cells
  that are resistant to the corrosive influences of what happens</span> <span m='1171000'>in
  the small intestine. And, therefore,</span> <span m='1174000'>we're just going to
  use these cells for a very short period of time and</span> <span m='1178000'>then
  get rid of them. What that also means is the</span> <span m='1181000'>following.
  The stem cells down here stay within that crypt.</span> </p><p><span m='1184000'>They
  don't migrate out. They stay there in that shielded</span> <span m='1188000'>site.
  And, in fact, if you think all this through,</span> <span m='1191000'>it's very
  important to protect these cells from becoming mutated because</span> <span m='1194000'>if
  they do become mutated they could become the precursors</span> <span m='1198000'>of
  cancer cells. If these cells become mutated out</span> <span m='1202000'>here, it
  doesn't matter because they're going to die anyhow.</span> </p><p><span m='1206000'>And
  so, we now have the following kind of dynamic.</span> </p><p><span m='1211000'>Here's
  the stem cell. I'll draw it again. I'll just</span> <span m='1215000'>abbreviate
  it stem cell. And one of the ways by which we</span> <span m='1220000'>want to preserve
  the genetic integrity of the stem cell is to</span> <span m='1224000'>insure that
  the stem cell divides as infrequently as possible. Why?</span> </p><p><span m='1229000'>Because
  the whole process of cell division is itself a fallible</span> <span m='1232000'>process.
  Every time a cell grows and divides, as we learned from the</span> <span m='1236000'>cell
  cycle, there's the possibility of different kinds of genetic</span> <span m='1240000'>disasters
  happening in which case we might end up with a mutant stem cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1244000'>And that mutant stem cell could in turn, I argue,</span> <span m='1247000'>become
  involved in creating a tumor. So, we have the following kind of</span> <span m='1251000'>arrangement.
  Here is the stem cell. It has one daughter that has</span> <span m='1255000'>committed
  herself to differentiate and the other that remains</span> <span m='1259000'>a stem
  cell. Well, you're saying this enormous</span> <span m='1263000'>amount of activity
  must involve a frenetic amount of cell division on</span> <span m='1268000'>the
  part of the stem cell. But that's not really the way it</span> <span m='1273000'>happens
  because this daughter cell undergoes a series of exponential</span> <span m='1279000'>divisions,
  I can't fit them all on the blackboard here,</span> <span m='1284000'>and might
  even yield a hundred descendents which then become the</span> <span m='1289000'>ultimate
  differentiated cell. This daughter cell becomes one stem</span> <span m='1294000'>cell.
  This daughter cell undergoes these exponential expansions in a</span> <span m='1298000'>process
  of creating a population of cells that are called transit</span> <span m='1302000'>amplifying
  cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1313000'>And at the bottom of this hierarchy, I can't
  draw all hundred, there may</span> <span m='1316000'>be a hundred of these cells,
  ten to the second, and these cells</span> <span m='1319000'>then differentiate.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1326000'>At the bottom, the hundred cells at the bottom,</span>
  <span m='1330000'>they go into the last stage of differentiation.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1334000'>They become the specialized cells that line the tips of the villis.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1338000'>Now, why is there this arrangement? Well, look at what
  the advantage of</span> <span m='1342000'>it is. The stem cell has just divided
  once, but this cell has</span> <span m='1346000'>generated a hundred progeny. And
  that means that the stem cell</span> <span m='1350000'>doesn't have to divide that
  often. The stem cell can divide once.</span> </p><p><span m='1354000'>Every time
  the villis needs a hundred new cells it needs to divide</span> <span m='1358000'>only
  once. And, therefore, the stem cell actually is</span> <span m='1362000'>one of
  the most slowly dividing cells in the entire gut because it</span> <span m='1366000'>only
  needs to divide episodically. Each time it divides it generates</span> <span m='1370000'>this
  enormous array of progeny. One other aspect of differentiation,</span> <span m='1374000'>and
  when I talk about differentiation here,</span> <span m='1378000'>I mean the acquisition
  by these cells of all of the traits they need</span> <span m='1382000'>to line the
  colon. When I talk about differentiation in</span> <span m='1386000'>the skin, I
  talk about the ability, the acquisition of the cells of</span> <span m='1392000'>becoming
  fully competent, fully functional skin cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1397000'>The
  same thing with neurons in the brain. And one additional important</span> <span
  m='1403000'>concept I'd like to introduce is that when cells differentiate they</span>
  <span m='1409000'>often become post-mitotic. Post-mitotic means that these cells</span>
  <span m='1414000'>give up the option of ever dividing again. In other words,</span>
  <span m='1418000'>as they acquire more and more specialized traits they say to</span>
  <span m='1422000'>themselves now I'm a nerve cell, now I'm a cell in the tip of
  villis</span> <span m='1426000'>in the intestine, now I'm a muscle cell,</span>
  <span m='1430000'>I'm not going to divide ever again. And this is generally true.
  The</span> <span m='1434000'>most differentiated cells in the body in general end
  up losing the</span> <span m='1438000'>ability to divide. They become post-mitotic.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1442000'>They've exited irreversibly from the cell cycle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1446000'>They can't go back in. As you recall, we talked about</span>
  <span m='1451000'>cells going from G0 back into the active G1 phase of the cell
  cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>That's a reversible exit from the cell cycle.
  Post-mitotic cells are</span> <span m='1460000'>irreversibly committed never to
  divide again. And,</span> <span m='1465000'>again, that holds true for almost all
  cells of the body.</span> </p><p><span m='1470000'>One exception to that is, interesting
  enough, in the liver.</span> </p><p><span m='1474000'>Because what you can do with
  a mouse, or even with a human,</span> <span m='1478000'>is you can cut away a couple
  lobes of the liver, major league surgery.</span> </p><p><span m='1483000'>And when
  you do that, what happens is that all the remaining cells of</span> <span m='1487000'>the
  liver, and these remaining cells in the liver are called hepatocytes,</span> <span
  m='1492000'>these hepatocytes, which until that time had been highly specialized</span>
  <span m='1496000'>differentiated cells in the liver, many of them divide, they double</span>
  <span m='1500000'>again. And in short order one ends up with</span> <span m='1504000'>a
  liver which is exactly the same size as one had before.</span> </p><p><span m='1507000'>And
  that's actually quite remarkable because there are very</span> <span m='1510000'>few
  organs in the adult human being where that will happen.</span> </p><p><span m='1512000'>There
  is, by the way, an interesting puzzle here,</span> <span m='1515000'>and that is
  the following. Let's say you cut away half the</span> <span m='1518000'>liver and
  many of the hepatocytes, which were already highly</span> <span m='1521000'>differentiated,
  began to divide again,</span> <span m='1524000'>so they were not serious post-mitotic
  cells,</span> <span m='1527000'>they could reenter into proliferative phase.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1530000'>How do these cells know when to stop dividing so that they
  end up</span> <span m='1534000'>regenerating a liver of exactly the right size?
  People have been</span> <span m='1538000'>looking at that for 30 or 40 years. Nobody
  has any idea why. Why</span> <span m='1543000'>doesn't the liver when all these
  cells divide become one and a half</span> <span m='1547000'>times the size of its
  former diameter or half the size?</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>Nobody really
  understands that. In any case, I just want to</span> <span m='1556000'>indicate
  that there is this dynamic between differentiation and</span> <span m='1560000'>proliferative
  capacity, one in opposition to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='1565000'>Well,
  how much hematopoiesis is taking place here in our bone marrow,</span> <span m='1570000'>for
  example, where a lot of this takes place? So,</span> <span m='1576000'>here are
  just some interesting numbers. There are roughly five</span> <span m='1582000'>times
  ten to the twelfth red blood cells --</span> <span m='1588000'>-- per liter of blood.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1594000'>And red blood cells, you may recall, are called erythrocytes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1600000'>Remember, it's never good to use a short Anglo-Saxon term
  if you can</span> <span m='1605000'>use a long complicated Greek one. And each of
  these red blood cells</span> <span m='1611000'>has roughly a lifetime of 120 days.
  That is to say after it's made it</span> <span m='1616000'>sits around in the blood
  for roughly 120 days.</span> </p><p><span m='1622000'>It gets warn out. It gets
  gobbled up by the cells in</span> <span m='1626000'>the spleen. Much of the contents
  are recycled. The pigment in our</span> <span m='1631000'>stool comes from the recycling
  of the hemoglobin,</span> <span m='1636000'>the iron and the hemoglobin, and we're
  constantly renewing that.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>Well, the average human
  being, let's say, has roughly ten liters of</span> <span m='1645000'>blood per person.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1652000'>And if you put all those numbers together, I once calculated
  that the</span> <span m='1656000'>number of red blood cells that is being generated
  in the body is</span> <span m='1661000'>roughly ten to the tenth per hour. And you
  can go through the</span> <span m='1665000'>calculations if you want, it is fine
  with me, but take my word</span> <span m='1670000'>for it's roughly what's going
  on there. Ten to the tenth per hour.</span> </p><p><span m='1674000'>Each time I
  utter a word there's probably, I don't know,</span> <span m='1679000'>ten to the
  seventh new red blood cells being made in my bone marrow.</span> </p><p><span m='1684000'>So,
  this is not minor league proliferation.</span> </p><p><span m='1687000'>Now we begin
  to understand why there are ten to the sixteenth cell</span> <span m='1691000'>divisions
  in the lifetime of a human being. In fact,</span> <span m='1695000'>a great majority
  of them, to be fair, are occurring in the</span> <span m='1699000'>bone marrow and
  in the intestine. And if you have an individual who's</span> <span m='1702000'>being
  exposed to certain kinds of chemotherapy, chemotherapy,</span> <span m='1706000'>as
  you may know, is very toxic for dividing cells,</span> <span m='1710000'>and the
  side effect toxicity of anticancer chemotherapy is largely</span> <span m='1714000'>felt,
  first of all, in the bone marrow where individuals</span> <span m='1718000'>tend
  to become anemic. Anemic means they have lower than</span> <span m='1722000'>normal
  numbers of red blood cells and also they lose a lot of the</span> <span m='1726000'>lining
  of the intestine which creates all kinds of also</span> <span m='1731000'>unpleasantness
  as well. So, we're not talking about</span> <span m='1735000'>something that happens
  on rare occasion in the life</span> <span m='1739000'>an individual. This is a staggering
  amount of</span> <span m='1744000'>mitosis that's happening every day of our lives.
  Let's go back for a</span> <span m='1748000'>moment to this diagram here and realize
  that when I'm talking about</span> <span m='1752000'>erythrocytes, I'm only talking
  about one of the branches of this</span> <span m='1756000'>multi-branch pathway.
  And here we see some other</span> <span m='1760000'>interesting aspects of what's
  going on here, and I'll give you some</span> <span m='1764000'>proofs very shortly
  that this actually is what it says it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1768000'>It actually
  is organized this way. The pluripotent stem cell is capable</span> <span m='1772000'>of
  self-renewal, and it can spew off daughters which</span> <span m='1776000'>actually
  can go in two different directions. Its daughter may decide</span> <span m='1780000'>that
  it might become the precursor of the lymphoid cells in the blood</span> <span m='1784000'>or
  it might commit itself to becoming a myeloid precursor.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>So,
  that's already the beginning of a bifurcation.</span> </p><p><span m='1792000'>These
  cells are not yet differentiated.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>They've just made
  the commitment that each of them can,</span> <span m='1800000'>in principle, become
  the ancestor of highly differentiated cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1805000'>And
  these cells, we can imagine, are transient</span> <span m='1808000'>amplifying cells
  in the sense that even though they're committed to</span> <span m='1812000'>create
  progeny of one sort or another they themselves are not yet</span> <span m='1816000'>fully
  differentiated. Keep in mind in the context of the</span> <span m='1819000'>crypt
  these transient amplifying cells are on the way to becoming</span> <span m='1823000'>fully
  differentiated, but only at the bottom of this</span> <span m='1827000'>exponential
  expansion of cells do we have cells that are fully entered</span> <span m='1831000'>into
  a highly differentiated state. Here we see that these two cells are</span> <span
  m='1835000'>also stem cells in the sense that the can self-renew.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1839000'>They have a limited self-renewal capacity, but they can self-renew.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1844000'>And then they begin to create progeny which themselves
  can</span> <span m='1848000'>undertake several distinct alternative differentiation
  paths.</span> </p><p><span m='1853000'>So, the lymphoid cells can become the progenitors
  of the T lymphocytes</span> <span m='1857000'>and the B lymphocytes. And, in fact,
  if you recall our</span> <span m='1862000'>discussion of immunology, there's actually
  several different</span> <span m='1866000'>kinds of T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes.
  So,</span> <span m='1870000'>this pathway has further radiations further down. Here,</span>
  <span m='1874000'>alternatively, these are the myeloid cells. And myeloid refers
  to the</span> <span m='1878000'>bone marrow. And the myeloid cells can become these
  kinds of cells up</span> <span m='1882000'>here, eosinophils and basophils and neutrophils
  and monocytes,</span> <span m='1886000'>and this class of cells is largely involved
  in gobbling up infectious</span> <span m='1890000'>agents and as agents which are
  able to defend us largely against</span> <span m='1894000'>bacterial infections.
  Here's the macrophage.</span> </p><p><span m='1898000'>We talked about the macrophage.
  Remember the macrophage was this</span> <span m='1902000'>glutton, this pig which
  wandered around our tissues and gobbled up</span> <span m='1905000'>whatever kind
  of material it could find and presented it to the immune</span> <span m='1909000'>system.
  And here are several other of the lineages.</span> </p><p><span m='1912000'>Here
  is a megakaryocytic and this is an erythrocyte.</span> </p><p><span m='1916000'>What's
  a megakariocyte? Well, it has a very large nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>That's
  what the term implies. And what happens to the</span> <span m='1924000'>megakariocyte
  is it buds off little chunks of cytoplasm lacking nuclei.</span> </p><p><span m='1929000'>And
  these little chunks of cytoplasm become the blood platelets.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1933000'>Blood platelets lack nuclei. They're enucleate because they're</span>
  <span m='1938000'>just little bags of material which are sent out into the circulation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1942000'>And, as we said also earlier in the semester, once the
  platelets are in</span> <span m='1947000'>the circulation they are there ready to
  help should there be any kind of</span> <span m='1951000'>wounding, any kind of
  hemorrhaging occurring.</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>And the platelets can release
  upon being activated in a site of wound</span> <span m='1959000'>coagulation factors
  and growth factors for the regeneration and</span> <span m='1963000'>reconstruction
  of wound sites. And, finally, here are our friends</span> <span m='1967000'>the
  erythrocytes. So, here we have a whole sequence</span> <span m='1971000'>of different
  kinds of differentiation commitments which</span> <span m='1975000'>are going on
  at an enormous rate. How do we know that there actually</span> <span m='1979000'>is
  a pluripotent stem cell? What evidence can I provide you that</span> <span m='1983000'>this
  actually exists or it's just a figment of my normally florid</span> <span m='1987000'>imagination?
  And the most direct demonstration of that is,</span> <span m='1992000'>in fact,
  the use of bone marrow transplantation.</span> </p><p><span m='1996000'>So, when
  we talk about a bone marrow transplantation,</span> <span m='2001000'>or BMT as
  it's called in the trade, --</span> <span m='2006000'>-- one can do a relatively
  simple</span> <span m='2013000'>experiment. You can take a mouse or even a human
  and you can irradiate</span> <span m='2017000'>it rather heavily. And if you irradiate
  it under the</span> <span m='2021000'>right conditions you'll actually be able to
  kill off all the cells in</span> <span m='2024000'>the bone marrow without killing
  off the mouse or the human being.</span> </p><p><span m='2028000'>In fact, there
  are drugs you can also use in human beings to</span> <span m='2032000'>eliminate
  virtually all the cells in the bone marrow.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>And
  then what you can do is you can take bone marrow from another</span> <span m='2039000'>organism,
  from another mouse or another human,</span> <span m='2043000'>and you inject it
  into the blood of the irradiated mouse or human.</span> </p><p><span m='2047000'>And
  the bone marrow cells, many of them will home to the bone</span> <span m='2050000'>marrow.
  In other words, you're injecting the bone marrow</span> <span m='2054000'>cells
  in the general circulation, but within a couple hours they'll</span> <span m='2057000'>all
  end up in the bone marrow, in the space in the middle of the</span> <span m='2061000'>bone
  because there are many kinds of cells which have this homing</span> <span m='2065000'>capacity.
  They go to the right place in the body.</span> </p><p><span m='2069000'>So, they
  can home. The injected cells can home to bone</span> <span m='2073000'>marrow. And
  then, if things are going well,</span> <span m='2077000'>these injected bone marrow
  cells will begin to proliferate and they</span> <span m='2081000'>will ultimately
  regenerate this entire cascade of differentiation</span> <span m='2085000'>decisions,
  as is indicated here. And, therefore, that individual or</span> <span m='2089000'>that
  mouse will actually be rescued. Because in the absence of such a</span> <span m='2093000'>rescue
  an individual will rapidly die.</span> </p><p><span m='2098000'>You can't live for
  very long in the absence of an active bone marrow</span> <span m='2101000'>because
  these cells here are rapidly depleted. They turn over with some</span> <span m='2105000'>speed.
  The red blood cells hang around for 120 days we said and,</span> <span m='2108000'>therefore,
  you don't need to make them immediately because there's a</span> <span m='2112000'>whole
  bunch around that have a rather slow turnover.</span> </p><p><span m='2115000'>But
  the platelets only have a lifetime of several days before</span> <span m='2119000'>they're
  lost, they're turned over. And if you don't have platelets</span> <span m='2122000'>you're
  in very bad shape because you start hemorrhaging all over the body</span> <span
  m='2126000'>because, remember, the platelets are there to stop up</span> <span m='2129000'>all
  the holes in the dike to prevent bleeding.</span> </p><p><span m='2133000'>These
  cells here are very important, the eosinophils, basophils,</span> <span m='2137000'>neutrophils,
  and even macrophages in preventing bacterial infections.</span> </p><p><span m='2141000'>And
  in the absence of having these on site one can readily succumb to</span> <span m='2145000'>overwhelming
  infections. Keep in mind that the reason why</span> <span m='2149000'>we're not
  constantly dying from bacterial infections is not because</span> <span m='2153000'>each
  of us takes an antibiotic pill every day, it's because these cells</span> <span
  m='2157000'>are on watch to kill any bacteria that happen to be in the wrong place</span>
  <span m='2161000'>in the body outside of the lumen of the gut.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2165000'>And consequently the question is always can one rescue a mouse or a</span>
  <span m='2169000'>human rapidly enough? Can one replace its bone marrow</span> <span
  m='2174000'>rapidly enough so that this disaster from losing all ones bone marrow</span>
  <span m='2179000'>doesn't overtake one and the organism dies before the bone marrow</span>
  <span m='2183000'>has had a chance to become reconstituted, regenerated,</span>
  <span m='2188000'>reconstructed. Still how do we know from all this</span> <span
  m='2192000'>that, in fact, there is a pluripotent stem cell?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2196000'>If you listened to everything I said correctly you could say,</span>
  <span m='2199000'>well, there isn't such a thing as a pluripotent stem cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2203000'>There are these other kinds of stem cells, this one and
  this one,</span> <span m='2206000'>or these might all be stem cells. And when I'm
  injecting the bone</span> <span m='2210000'>marrow of a donor animal into the recipient,
  I'm injecting a whole</span> <span m='2214000'>mixture of different kinds of stem
  cells here each of which then goes</span> <span m='2217000'>on and populates a specialized
  compartment in the bone marrow</span> <span m='2221000'>or in the blood. So how
  do we know there's one</span> <span m='2225000'>pluripotent stem cell? One way to
  prove this is the</span> <span m='2229000'>following. Let's say we take the bone
  marrow from the donor,</span> <span m='2234000'>that is the bone marrow that we're
  going to inject into the irradiated</span> <span m='2238000'>recipient, and we irradiate
  that bone marrow very lightly,</span> <span m='2243000'>not to kill the bone marrow
  cells but to introduce random chromosomal</span> <span m='2248000'>breaks, a very
  small number of random chromosomal breaks in the</span> <span m='2252000'>donor
  bone marrow. So, the purpose now of irradiation</span> <span m='2257000'>is quite
  different from what I said before. Before we wanted to give a</span> <span m='2261000'>heavy
  dose of radiation to wipe out the recipient bone marrow.</span> </p><p><span m='2265000'>Now
  we're going to just give a wee bit of radiation to the donor bone</span> <span m='2269000'>marrow.
  What's the purpose of that? The purpose of that small amount of</span> <span m='2273000'>radiation
  is to create chromosomal abnormalities.</span> </p><p><span m='2278000'>So, for
  example, if here are two homologous</span> <span m='2283000'>chromosomes in the
  donor cells. Since the radiation, the very weak</span> <span m='2289000'>dose of
  radiation is acting randomly it will create all kinds of</span> <span m='2294000'>abnormalities
  including, for example, a very specific</span> <span m='2300000'>chromosomal translocation
  so that what might happen after this is that</span> <span m='2305000'>a whole chunk
  of this chromosome is translocated over to this chromosome</span> <span m='2311000'>here.
  This is called a chromosomal translocation.</span> </p><p><span m='2317000'>And
  now here's the donor,</span> <span m='2324000'>these are donor bone marrow cells.
  And keep in mind that every donor</span> <span m='2328000'>bone marrow cell that
  gets a little bit of this radiation will get its</span> <span m='2332000'>own very
  specific randomly occurring translocation just because radiation</span> <span m='2336000'>is
  able to break chromosomes and then they will rejoin in</span> <span m='2340000'>unpredictable
  ways. What that means is that if we take</span> <span m='2344000'>the donor bone
  marrow and irradiate it very lightly so that we don't</span> <span m='2348000'>kill
  the cells but we do induce these translocations,</span> <span m='2352000'>one donor
  cell will have this translocation and another donor cell</span> <span m='2357000'>over
  here will have a totally different translocation from a</span> <span m='2361000'>different
  chromosome also induced randomly by these stochastic</span> <span m='2365000'>processes.
  So the karyotype which is the whole</span> <span m='2370000'>array of chromosomes
  of a cell, which can be viewed at the metaphase</span> <span m='2374000'>of mitosis
  when all the chromosomes condense, the karyotype of each of</span> <span m='2379000'>these
  donor bone marrow cells will be messed up slightly.</span> </p><p><span m='2383000'>And
  it will have recognizable abnormalities,</span> <span m='2388000'>but they're all
  different, one after the other. And after</span> <span m='2393000'>we've done this,
  after we've marked millions of bone</span> <span m='2397000'>marrow cells in the
  donor with these random low-dose radiations,</span> <span m='2402000'>we can then
  inject a small number of bone marrow cells into</span> <span m='2406000'>the recipient.
  And what we can sometimes find on</span> <span m='2411000'>occasion is if we look
  at the recipient after that recipient has</span> <span m='2415000'>been rescued,
  i. ., after the donor bone marrow has</span> <span m='2419000'>established itself
  within the recipient, is that the donor bone</span> <span m='2423000'>marrow is
  established in the recipient and populates all of these</span> <span m='2427000'>different
  lineages. And if we're able to look at the</span> <span m='2431000'>karyotype of
  these different kinds of cells in the recipient organism,</span> <span m='2435000'>we
  can find that in some mice all of these cells have the same very</span> <span m='2439000'>peculiar
  translocation. They have either this one or this</span> <span m='2443000'>one or
  they have yet a third translocation,</span> <span m='2446000'>any one of a whole
  series of randomly occurring mutations,</span> <span m='2450000'>a very peculiar
  idiosyncratic unusual translocation induced by the</span> <span m='2454000'>low-dose
  radiation. They all have it.</span> </p><p><span m='2458000'>The T cells and the
  B cells and the monocytes and the basophiles,</span> <span m='2462000'>they all
  have exactly the same translocation.</span> </p><p><span m='2466000'>Obviously,
  we can't do that experiment with the platelets.</span> </p><p><span m='2470000'>Why?
  Because they don't have nuclei. And we can't do that with</span> <span m='2474000'>the
  erythrocytes either, the red blood cells. Why can't we</span> <span m='2478000'>do
  that? Because in mammals, when the red blood cells are formed,</span> <span m='2482000'>the
  nuclei are spit out. Our red blood cells don't have nuclei in</span> <span m='2486000'>them
  anymore. They've become enucleate or, to put it another way,</span> <span m='2490000'>they
  have been enucleated. That is to say they've been deprived</span> <span m='2494000'>of
  their nuclei. Why? Because they're post-mitotic.</span> </p><p><span m='2498000'>Obviously,
  a cell which lacks nuclei is by definition post-mitotic.</span> </p><p><span m='2503000'>And
  our cells don't really need, red blood cells don't need nuclei.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2507000'>We know that ancestral organisms, for instance chickens,</span> <span
  m='2512000'>their red blood cells are nucleated, but our red blood cells are not</span>
  <span m='2516000'>because they're just not necessary.</span> </p><p><span m='2522000'>How
  is translocation different from crossing over?</span> </p><p><span m='2526000'>Crossing
  over occurs between two homologous chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='2531000'>So
  if we have a chromosome here, here's chromosome 13 and here's</span> <span m='2535000'>another
  chromosome 13, they're both chromosomes 13.</span> </p><p><span m='2540000'>This
  one came from Ma. This one came from Pa. All right?</span> </p><p><span m='2545000'>Each
  of us has a pair of homologous chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='2550000'>Here's
  the maternal one. Here's the paternal one.</span> </p><p><span m='2553000'>When
  we talk about crossing over we're talking about a process of</span> <span m='2557000'>homologous
  recombination.</span> </p><p><span m='2567000'>And when that happens we have a situation
  like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2570000'>This chunk is exchanged with this chunk
  over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2573000'>It's an equal exchange, absolutely equal
  down to the</span> <span m='2576000'>nucleotide, so that after this flipping has
  occurred we have two</span> <span m='2580000'>fully intact chromosomes. It's just
  that both of these</span> <span m='2584000'>chromosomes are fully normal. It's just
  that there's been a</span> <span m='2588000'>switching, an exchange between the
  two homologous chromosomes,</span> <span m='2592000'>the two paired chromosomes
  13. When we talk about translocation</span> <span m='2596000'>there a chunk of chromosome
  15 can go onto chromosome 7 or a chunk of</span> <span m='2600000'>chromosome 2
  can go on chromosome 8. It's totally random, it's</span> <span m='2604000'>non-homologous,
  and it creates aberrant chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='2608000'>Neither of
  these recombined chromosomes is abnormal.</span> </p><p><span m='2612000'>It's just
  changed it allelic configuration.</span> </p><p><span m='2616000'>So, it's an important
  distinction. And the fact is you can pick out</span> <span m='2620000'>these translocated
  chromosomes because one even has specific dyes</span> <span m='2625000'>that can
  be able to tell you which chromosome this came from and which</span> <span m='2629000'>chromosome
  this came from. So, there is a profound difference.</span> </p><p><span m='2633000'>Translocations
  are, invariably, pathologic. When I say pathologic,</span> <span m='2637000'>I mean
  they're really sick. They're not the proper course of</span> <span m='2642000'>things
  that happens in a healthy cell. The fact,</span> <span m='2646000'>the very fact
  that we're able to generate an entire array of cells in</span> <span m='2651000'>the
  blood indicated, by necessity, that if all these</span> <span m='2655000'>cells
  have the same chromosomal translocation that they descend from</span> <span m='2660000'>a
  donor cell that originally was lightly irradiated and happened to</span> <span m='2664000'>receive
  that translocation. If we never get this array of common</span> <span m='2668000'>translocations
  in all the cells in a bone marrow recipient then we can't</span> <span m='2672000'>prove
  this, but the fact is this has been proven time and again over the</span> <span
  m='2676000'>years. And this indicates to us that this cell which is genetically</span>
  <span m='2680000'>slightly altered can, therefore, generate all these other</span>
  <span m='2684000'>cells in the body. Again, keep in mind that the</span> <span m='2688000'>irradiation
  of the donor marrow is simply to create these chromosomal</span> <span m='2692000'>markings.
  They're not necessarily good for the organism,</span> <span m='2696000'>but they
  don't compromise the viability of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>They
  just reshuffle the chromosomal structure. Now,</span> <span m='2704000'>in principle
  the levels of each one of these kinds of end-stage cells</span> <span m='2709000'>need
  to be carefully regulated. And, by the way, let me just note</span> <span m='2713000'>here,
  you see the T cells have the arrow going back on themselves,</span> <span m='2718000'>as
  do the B cells. That indicates that they have not become</span> <span m='2723000'>post-mitotic.
  Remember we talked about these embraces between helper</span> <span m='2727000'>T
  cells and B cells where they're walking down the allies and they get</span> <span
  m='2732000'>excited and they start multiplying? The fact that the T cells and the
  B</span> <span m='2736000'>cells are able to proliferate in response to certain
  antigenic</span> <span m='2740000'>stimuli implies that they're not post-mitotic.
  They still have the</span> <span m='2743000'>ability to proliferate, and that retained
  ability to</span> <span m='2747000'>proliferate like that of hepatocytes is indicated
  by these arrows that</span> <span m='2750000'>are looping back on themselves. Conversely,
  these cells are all</span> <span m='2754000'>essentially, as I've said before, post-mitotic.
  So how do we insure</span> <span m='2757000'>that's there proper concentrations
  of all of these different</span> <span m='2761000'>cells in the blood? And the fact
  is the concentrations</span> <span m='2765000'>of many of these cells in the blood
  are maintained to concentrations of</span> <span m='2770000'>plus or minus 10%.
  And this is, itself,</span> <span m='2774000'>a stunning testimonial to the successes
  of human physiology.</span> </p><p><span m='2779000'>We're talking here about a
  process which is sometimes called</span> <span m='2784000'>homeostasis. Homeostasis
  means that somehow there is a balance,</span> <span m='2788000'>an equilibrium that
  is achieved, and that there aren't profound</span> <span m='2793000'>fluctuations
  so that we always have roughly the equal level of red blood</span> <span m='2798000'>cells,
  a proper level of lymphocytes in our blood.</span> </p><p><span m='2803000'>And
  I want to get into the homeostasis which results in the</span> <span m='2807000'>formation
  of red blood cells, the RBCs, the erythrocytes in the</span> <span m='2812000'>blood.
  In fact, it happens to be the case that the</span> <span m='2816000'>red blood cells
  are one of the cell types that could actually vary quite</span> <span m='2821000'>profoundly
  in response to environment.</span> </p><p><span m='2826000'>To the extent that lymphocytes
  change, they go up and down,</span> <span m='2829000'>that might be due in response
  to an infection. So,</span> <span m='2832000'>if we have a serious bacterial infection
  we might have increased in</span> <span m='2835000'>the lymphocytes in the blood
  that have been mobilized in order to</span> <span m='2839000'>attack the infecting
  bacteria. But what about the RBCs? What</span> <span m='2842000'>about the red blood
  cells? What causes them to change?</span> </p><p><span m='2845000'>Well, if you
  move from here to Denver, Colorado or you go up skiing</span> <span m='2849000'>in
  the Rockies, you're going up to ten or twelve</span> <span m='2852000'>thousand
  feet. And within a matter of three or four</span> <span m='2856000'>days the concentration
  of your red blood cells increases very</span> <span m='2860000'>substantially. Why?
  Because obviously the oxygen</span> <span m='2865000'>tension at high altitude is
  down. And in order that your peripheral</span> <span m='2870000'>tissues become
  adequately oxygenated, the oxygen carrying capacity of the</span> <span m='2874000'>blood
  must be increased. And the way that is increased is in</span> <span m='2879000'>part
  to increase the concentration of red blood cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2884000'>So
  how does that happen? How is it possible that we can</span> <span m='2888000'>rapidly
  modulate the concentration of red blood cells?</span> </p><p><span m='2893000'>And
  the way we can do that is in part through a hormone called</span> <span m='2897000'>erythropoietin,
  EPO. We're going to talk about</span> <span m='2902000'>erythropoietin at the beginning
  of the lecture next time,</span> <span m='2907000'>but the homeostasis which maintains
  the appropriate number of red blood</span> <span m='2911000'>cells in our circulation
  is dictated in no small part by the levels of</span> <span m='2916000'>EPO that
  are in their blood. To anticipate some of the things</span> <span m='2921000'>we're
  going to say next time, when you are in a low-oxygen</span> <span m='2925000'>environment
  the levels of erythropoietin shoot up.</span> </p><p><span m='2929000'>And when
  they shoot up they insure that there is shortly thereafter a</span> <span m='2933000'>rapid
  increase in the level of circulating red blood cells which in</span> <span m='2937000'>turn
  enables the oxygen coming into your lungs to be transported more</span> <span m='2941000'>efficiently,
  more effectively into the peripheral tissues.</span> </p><p><span m='2946000'>You've
  heard about athletes perhaps who are able to dope themselves with</span> <span m='2950000'>erythropoietin.
  This is a rather devious strategy</span> <span m='2954000'>because it means that
  if they do so, they inject themselves with a little</span> <span m='2958000'>erythropoietin,
  the oxygen carrying capacity of</span> <span m='2962000'>their blood is temporarily
  increased and as a consequence they might be</span> <span m='2966000'>able to run
  further or jump higher. This, by the way,</span> <span m='2969000'>has its dangers.
  Because if you're injecting erythropoietin not in</span> <span m='2973000'>response
  to certain physiologic signals but just because you want to</span> <span m='2977000'>win
  a marathon or something, you're violating the normal</span> <span m='2981000'>physiologic
  mechanisms in the body which very carefully control the</span> <span m='2985000'>levels
  of erythropoietin. And if you inject too much</span> <span m='2989000'>erythropoietin
  you get in a very bad situation because the bone marrow</span> <span m='2993000'>makes
  more and more red blood cells. And then what happens? You start</span> <span m='2997000'>clotting
  up everywhere all over the body, and this isn't good.</span> </p><p><span m='3001000'>In
  fact, you can die. So this is not a warning against</span> <span m='3005000'>erythropoietin
  in the way that I warned you against cigarettes.</span> </p><p><span m='3010000'>This
  is just to tell you these kinds of drugs,</span> <span m='3014000'>or these kinds
  of growth factors, which they are, are maintained at</span> <span m='3019000'>very
  precise levels as we'll discuss in more detail next time.</span> </p><p><span m='3023000'>See
  you on Wednesday.</span> </p>
