transcript: <p><span m='1000'>I actually would like to take this occasion to praise
  and thank the TAs.</span> </p><p><span m='5000'>We've been teaching this course
  for about a dozen years and we've had</span> <span m='10000'>some really excellent
  groups of TAs, but this year's crop is really off</span> <span m='16000'>scale,
  really outstanding. And we're all very grateful.</span> </p><p><span m='21000'>[APPLAUSE]
  You know their names. I won't go through them all.</span> </p><p><span m='27000'>But
  the fact of the matter is these TAs teach this course because</span> <span m='31000'>they're
  told to teach the course, and at the same time they're doing</span> <span m='35000'>all
  their thesis research, so they end spending about 168 hours</span> <span m='39000'>a
  week on various kinds of work. So it's not a natural thing for</span> <span m='43000'>them
  to spend an enormous amount of time, as they have been this year,</span> <span m='47000'>really
  just off scale extraordinarily good.</span> </p><p><span m='51000'>Here they are,
  Winston, Susan, Michelle, Sara, Divia,</span> <span m='55000'>Jim, Sydney, Yasmine
  and Cha. So thank you all.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>At the same time, I'd also
  like to thank Claudette</span> <span m='63000'>Gardel who runs this thing. This
  is a large undertaking,</span> <span m='67000'>believe it or not, with almost 350
  students enrolled,</span> <span m='71000'>but it's moved seamlessly and without
  any problems this year for</span> <span m='75000'>which many of us are very grateful.
  So, thank you Claudette. I'm going</span> <span m='78000'>to spend today trying
  to broadcast into the future,</span> <span m='82000'>forecast into the future I
  should say, about where all of what we've</span> <span m='86000'>talked about this
  semester is taking us.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>Where is it going to get it
  us in terms of where we're going to be ten</span> <span m='93000'>or twenty years
  from now and what you're going to be in the middle of</span> <span m='97000'>ten
  or twenty years from now as you begin to move,</span> <span m='101000'>as it will
  happen surely, as day follows night, into midlife.</span> </p><p><span m='105000'>Imagine
  that. When you're 35 or 40 this will happen.</span> </p><p><span m='108000'>And
  in order to do so I just want to go back 125 years or so to give</span> <span m='112000'>you
  a feeling for what the history of biology has been like,</span> <span m='116000'>some
  of it, since the end of the 19th century.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>Just to
  give you a little flavor for what can happen to biology if things</span> <span m='124000'>aren't
  done right. Charles Darwin had a cousin named</span> <span m='128000'>Francis Galton.
  He was knighted by the Queen and</span> <span m='133000'>called Sir Francis Galton.
  And he was an early pioneer in</span> <span m='137000'>statistics. And he coined
  the term eugenics. And,</span> <span m='141000'>as you may note, eugenics is simply
  the science of</span> <span m='146000'>trying to use genetics to bread better livestock,</span>
  <span m='150000'>better plants, and ultimately maybe to breed better human beings.</span>
  </p><p><span m='155000'>And we humans have been doing eugenics on plants and livestock
  for</span> <span m='159000'>at least 10,000 years. That is to say we have continually</span>
  <span m='163000'>been selecting out the best of the breed as the progenitors of
  the next</span> <span m='167000'>generation of the breed. And in that way corn,
  which was</span> <span m='171000'>originally this large when it was grown 5,000
  years ago in Mexico,</span> <span m='175000'>the cobs have now become this large
  and quite tasty.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>And all of that is through selective
  breeding. But in the last half of</span> <span m='184000'>the 19th century, inspired
  by Darwin and subsequently</span> <span m='188000'>by Mendel's work on Mendelian
  genetics, a whole science of</span> <span m='193000'>eugenics grew up in this country
  which included not only the</span> <span m='197000'>improvement in the quality of
  livestock and plants but also</span> <span m='202000'>improvements in the gene pool
  of humanity. There was a strong</span> <span m='206000'>conviction that genes were
  directly responsible for all kinds of</span> <span m='211000'>physical traits, as
  well as mental and psychological</span> <span m='215000'>traits. There was a strong
  belief that some</span> <span m='220000'>races were superior and other races were
  inferior because of genetic</span> <span m='225000'>gifts or genetic deficits. And
  this included as well within</span> <span m='229000'>races, however one defined
  them, different ethnic groups. There was</span> <span m='234000'>a firm belief that
  science could ultimately solve a lot of social</span> <span m='239000'>problems
  including urban violence, labor unrest, manic depression,</span> <span m='244000'>schizophrenia
  and even mental retardation.</span> </p><p><span m='249000'>And the eugenicists,
  as they came to be known,</span> <span m='252000'>came to believe that the problems
  of the world, alcoholism,</span> <span m='256000'>poverty, prostitution, criminality,
  feeblemindedness, chess playing</span> <span m='259000'>ability, tendency to commit
  industrial sabotage,</span> <span m='263000'>that was big in the beginning of the
  20th century when the unions were</span> <span m='266000'>coming into power, they
  were all associated with one or</span> <span m='270000'>another rather penetrant
  Mendelian allele.</span> </p><p><span m='274000'>A well known geneticist named Davenport,
  who subsequently was</span> <span m='278000'>associated with an unnamed university
  up Mass Ave.</span> </p><p><span m='282000'>studied various ethnic groups and races
  and concluded that on the</span> <span m='286000'>basis of genetics the Germans
  ranked highest in quality such as</span> <span m='290000'>leadership, humor, generosity,
  sympathy and loyalty.</span> </p><p><span m='294000'>Italians and Irish ranked lowest
  in most of these traits,</span> <span m='298000'>he was lucky he survived in this
  town since together Italians and</span> <span m='302000'>Irish, I think encompass
  70% of the population.</span> </p><p><span m='307000'>British were lowest in two
  of the traits. Irish were highest in</span> <span m='311000'>suspiciousness. Jews
  were highest in obtrusiveness,</span> <span m='316000'>whatever that is. And all
  of these things were said to be genetically</span> <span m='320000'>templated. And
  so at the beginning of World War I IQ tests were first</span> <span m='325000'>instituted
  in this country during the draft in order to determine who</span> <span m='329000'>was
  genetically fit to serve and who was below standard.</span> </p><p><span m='334000'>And
  using IQ tests, which were implemented in great</span> <span m='337000'>numbers
  and throughout the society in the 1920s, a well known</span> <span m='341000'>geneticist
  named Goddard discovered that 80% of Jewish,</span> <span m='345000'>Hungarian and
  Polish immigrants, as well as Italian and Russian</span> <span m='349000'>immigrants
  were mentally defective or feebleminded,</span> <span m='353000'>and that these
  traits, these mental defects in 80% of these</span> <span m='357000'>groups were
  transmitted as regularly and as surely as the color</span> <span m='361000'>of hair
  or eyes. I'm not making up fairy tales now.</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>I'm telling
  you what's happened in our history. In the 1920s there was</span> <span m='370000'>a
  Eugenics Record Office in this country which existed for the next</span> <span m='376000'>twenty
  years, an American Eugenics Society which has 1200 people,</span> <span m='381000'>and
  J.H. Kellogg of Battle Creek, Michigan, you know how he made his</span> <span m='386000'>money,
  don't you? Cornflakes. He founded a Race Betterment</span> <span m='390000'>Association
  whose intent was to better the gene pool of the American</span> <span m='394000'>population
  through selective breeding. By 1928 there were 376</span> <span m='398000'>college
  courses taught across this country on the subject of eugenics,</span> <span m='402000'>i.e.,
  how to improve the human race by beginning to breed more</span> <span m='406000'>fit
  individuals. And so when the Nazis came to power,</span> <span m='410000'>as they
  did in 1933 in Germany, they had much to draw from.</span> </p><p><span m='415000'>In
  fact, most of their scientific rationale, to the extent they had</span> <span m='421000'>any,
  didn't come from Germany, it came from eugenicists in the</span> <span m='426000'>United
  States. And so they began to look amongst</span> <span m='431000'>their society
  for people who were useless eaters,</span> <span m='436000'>i.e., they consumed
  food but didn't produce, they lived lives not worth</span> <span m='442000'>living,
  the elderly, the chronic poor, the crippled and</span> <span m='447000'>the misfits.
  And they began involuntary</span> <span m='452000'>sterilization. So, people who
  were regarded as</span> <span m='456000'>genetically less fit were sterilized. By
  the time the Nazis finished</span> <span m='461000'>their 12 years in power, 400,000
  people had been sterilized</span> <span m='466000'>in Germany because for one or
  another reason they were regarded as</span> <span m='470000'>somehow defective.
  And as the Second World War made</span> <span m='475000'>resources more tight, they
  just did something much simpler,</span> <span m='479000'>they just euthanized people,
  they just killed them if they were</span> <span m='484000'>regarded as in one way
  or another genetically defective.</span> </p><p><span m='489000'>In fact, my father
  had a first cousin who around 1936 or so was</span> <span m='493000'>gassed because
  he had a bad stuttering defect.</span> </p><p><span m='498000'>So, this is all things
  that really happened to people.</span> </p><p><span m='503000'>As a consequence
  of all of this eugenics, by 1924 Immigration Act</span> <span m='507000'>was passed
  which severely circumscribed the amount of people</span> <span m='512000'>immigrating
  into this country because the immigrants were widely</span> <span m='517000'>viewed
  as diluting and contaminating the American gene pool.</span> </p><p><span m='522000'>And
  this probably, well, this undoubtedly had a</span> <span m='525000'>devastating
  affect on this country which we'll never really be able to</span> <span m='528000'>know
  because the truth of the matter is that to the extent we have</span> <span m='531000'>economic
  and scientific robustness in this country,</span> <span m='535000'>it has come,
  for the last century, year after year, generation after</span> <span m='538000'>generation
  from the immigrants who come to this country,</span> <span m='541000'>not people
  who were here three, four, five generations.</span> </p><p><span m='545000'>It's
  the immigrants who brought in the new ideas,</span> <span m='549000'>the energy,
  the power, and I venture to say that if I were</span> <span m='553000'>to ask what
  fraction of you are first generation Americans the</span> <span m='557000'>number
  would be pretty high, right? But in 1924 that was for a</span> <span m='561000'>while
  stopped simply because people coming into the country were viewed</span> <span m='565000'>as
  genetically less than acceptable.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>By 1940 thirty
  states had compulsory sterilization laws in this country,</span> <span m='575000'>i.e.,
  people who were deemed to be genetically less gifted were</span> <span m='580000'>sterilized
  against their will. 60,000 of those sterilizations were</span> <span m='585000'>performed
  in this country. And the eugenics moment gained more</span> <span m='590000'>and
  more adherence. What shut it off ultimately was what</span> <span m='595000'>happened
  in World War II where six million Jews were killed,</span> <span m='599000'>along
  with probably five or six million Slavs and other races who</span> <span m='603000'>were
  deemed, and gypsies, there were probably half a million</span> <span m='607000'>gypsies
  killed by the Nazis, different groups of people who were</span> <span m='611000'>deemed
  to be genetically less deserving of living and genetically</span> <span m='615000'>less
  likely to be productive and useful human beings.</span> </p><p><span m='620000'>And
  were it not for World War II, it's quite plausible that the</span> <span m='625000'>eugenics
  movement would have continued to grow and that today,</span> <span m='630000'>when
  we talk about genetics, much of it would be referred to a belief</span> <span m='635000'>that
  somehow we can determine people's phenotype and genotype and</span> <span m='640000'>that
  we can predict how useful or useless they're going to be on the</span> <span m='645000'>basis
  of our insights into genetics. And this ideology of genetic</span> <span m='650000'>determinism,
  I say it had a great decline, this is the phrase we use,</span> <span m='655000'>genetic
  determinism, i.e., to say that an individual's life course is</span> <span m='660000'>strongly
  dictated by his or her genome.</span> </p><p><span m='665000'>These are her alleles.
  You heard a lot about the alleles</span> <span m='668000'>last time from Eric. But
  genetic determinism is once</span> <span m='672000'>again coming to the forefront.
  Why? Because now, for the first</span> <span m='676000'>time, we actually have a
  science of human genetics.</span> </p><p><span m='679000'>When all of this other
  stuff was going on 50 and 100 years ago it was</span> <span m='683000'>all pseudo-science,
  it was all made up. No one had the</span> <span m='687000'>vaguest idea what genes
  were present in people's DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='691000'>They didn't even know
  about DNA. They didn't really know about most</span> <span m='694000'>Mendelian
  traits being passed in human populations.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>And they
  had no way of knowing, in the vast majority of cases,</span> <span m='702000'>whether
  a certain person's phenotype was or was not dictated by genotype.</span> </p><p><span
  m='706000'>So is this notion of a strong genotype-phenotype connection</span> <span
  m='709000'>totally nonsense? Well, I'll give you an example of</span> <span m='713000'>where
  you might begin to think it isn't. And it comes from studies of</span> <span m='717000'>identical
  twins who were separated at birth and brought up</span> <span m='721000'>in different
  families. So these identical twins obviously</span> <span m='724000'>have an identical
  genotype. So here's a famous story that I</span> <span m='728000'>like to refer
  to. There was a chance meeting in 1979</span> <span m='732000'>between a steelworker
  named Jim Lewis and a clerical worker named</span> <span m='736000'>Jim Springer.
  They both lived in Ohio. They were separated five</span> <span m='739000'>weeks
  after birth and they were raised 80 miles apart in different</span> <span m='743000'>towns
  in Ohio. And at the age of 39 they</span> <span m='747000'>discovered themselves
  through some change meeting.</span> </p><p><span m='751000'>They discovered each
  other. Well, they both had dark hair,</span> <span m='754000'>they both stool six
  feet tall and they both weighed 180 pounds.</span> </p><p><span m='757000'>That's
  not so surprising. They both spoke with the same inflections,</span> <span m='761000'>which
  they clearly had not yet learned to speak with when they were</span> <span m='764000'>five
  weeks old. They walked with the same gait.</span> </p><p><span m='768000'>They made
  the same gestures. They both loved stockcar racing.</span> </p><p><span m='771000'>They
  both hated baseball. They both married women named Linda.</span> </p><p><span m='774000'>They
  were both divorced and in their second marriages both of them</span> <span m='778000'>married
  women named Betty. They both drove Chevrolets.</span> </p><p><span m='781000'>They
  drank Miller Lite. They both chain smoked Salems.</span> </p><p><span m='785000'>They
  vacationed on the same half-mile of beach in Florida.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>They
  both had elevated blood pressure, severe migraines,</span> <span m='792000'>both
  had undergone vasectomies, they both bit their nails, and their</span> <span m='795000'>heart
  rates, their brainwaves and their IQs were so similar that you</span> <span m='799000'>couldn't
  tell whether it was the same person or two separate people</span> <span m='802000'>being
  studied. Now, what do you begin to think of</span> <span m='806000'>all that? Well,
  that's an extreme case.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>The fact is most identical
  twins raised apart do have a bit of</span> <span m='815000'>divergence in their
  phenotype, in the way they grow up, but it</span> <span m='820000'>begins to plant
  in your mind the notion that maybe many aspects of</span> <span m='825000'>the way
  we think and act actually have a strong genetic template in</span> <span m='830000'>them.
  And one can begin to study identical twins and ask things about,</span> <span m='836000'>especially
  those who are separated at birth, and not use such extreme</span> <span m='841000'>anecdotes
  like the one I just used. And one begins to find that there's</span> <span m='846000'>an
  impressive list of attributes that can only be explained by their</span> <span m='850000'>being
  a strong genetic determinant in them. And these traits include</span> <span m='855000'>being
  alienated by people around one, extroverted, being a traditionalist,</span> <span
  m='860000'>looking backwards in terms of one's customs, leadership,</span> <span
  m='864000'>career choice, risk aversion, attention deficit disorder,</span> <span
  m='869000'>religious conviction and vulnerability to stress.</span> </p><p><span
  m='874000'>Heritability it turns out, if you study identical twins,</span> <span
  m='877000'>is about, I'm sorry, happiness, if you study identical twins, is</span>
  <span m='881000'>about 80% heritable it turns out and depends little on one's wealth,</span>
  <span m='885000'>achievement or marital status. But 80% of it, if you study identical</span>
  <span m='889000'>twins, seems to have a genetic template. And you'll say,</span>
  <span m='893000'>well, that's all very satisfying, but it begins to be a little</span>
  <span m='897000'>unsettling because it begins to cause each of us to ask are we</span>
  <span m='901000'>really who we think we are or are we just kind of cassette recorders
  who</span> <span m='905000'>are playing out the program that was stuffed into us
  when the sperm hit</span> <span m='909000'>the egg that lead to each of our appearing
  on the face</span> <span m='913000'>of the planet? To what extent are we individuals
  or</span> <span m='917000'>to what extent are we simply manifestations of genotype?</span>
  </p><p><span m='921000'>And to what extent do we have freewill? That's kind of an</span>
  <span m='925000'>interesting question. Now, people like Eric,</span> <span m='929000'>I'm
  not pointing an accusing finger, people like Eric have begun to</span> <span m='933000'>refine
  the science of genetics so it really is a science.</span> </p><p><span m='937000'>And
  so, restriction fragment polymorphisms,</span> <span m='940000'>SNPs, haplotype
  analysis are now uncovering a staggering array of</span> <span m='944000'>human
  traits. I believe that the number of human traits that have now</span> <span m='947000'>been
  localized, specific genes, most of these are</span> <span m='951000'>diseased genes,
  exceeds 2,000 is my recollection.</span> </p><p><span m='955000'>And there are only
  21,000, 22,000 genes in the human genome.</span> </p><p><span m='958000'>And the
  pace with which genes and genotype and phenotype will be</span> <span m='962000'>linked
  to one another is going to increase if nothing else.</span> </p><p><span m='966000'>Many
  of the traits that one thinks about in terms of human beings are</span> <span m='969000'>obviously
  polygenic. They're not single strong Mendelian</span> <span m='973000'>alleles with
  strong penitence. They represent the confluence,</span> <span m='977000'>the collaboration
  of multiple alleles that are conspiring to</span> <span m='981000'>create one or
  another phenotype. And these polygenic traits or even</span> <span m='985000'>polygenic
  diseases have traditionally resisted analysis</span> <span m='989000'>because mathematically
  they are so complex to dissect out,</span> <span m='993000'>to dissect out the contributing
  genes which together as a cohort</span> <span m='997000'>create a genotype. But,
  as Eric told you last time,</span> <span m='1001000'>people like you who are great
  software developers will one day</span> <span m='1005000'>begin to figure out how
  one can take extraordinarily complex datasets and</span> <span m='1010000'>begin
  to associate specific chromosomal regions,</span> <span m='1014000'>and ultimately
  genes, with specific genetic sequences that</span> <span m='1018000'>contribute
  to a polygenic trait. I think at one time Eric spent,</span> <span m='1023000'>about
  three or four years ago, he worked with people at Cornell</span> <span m='1027000'>studying
  the polygenic trade of ripening in tomatoes.</span> </p><p><span m='1031000'>It's
  a polygenic trait like probably chess playing ability in</span> <span m='1036000'>human
  beings. And was able to localize ripening rate of tomatoes</span> <span m='1040000'>to
  five or six distinct genetic regions in the chromosomes of the</span> <span m='1044000'>tomato
  plant. But that's only a harbinger of what could come.</span> </p><p><span m='1049000'>So
  let's imagine now, again, I'm not blaming Eric for this,</span> <span m='1052000'>I'm
  just telling you he's the one, he more than anyone else almost on</span> <span m='1056000'>the
  planet is the person who is leading the charge to refine and</span> <span m='1060000'>strengthen
  these extraordinarily powerful tools that enable us to</span> <span m='1063000'>discern
  how our genome creates us the way we are.</span> </p><p><span m='1067000'>But he's
  not going to be the one who applies these tools.</span> </p><p><span m='1071000'>They'll
  be applied all over the planet.</span> </p><p><span m='1075000'>There are geneticists
  everywhere who are interested in looking at how</span> <span m='1079000'>different
  aspects of human phenotype, including disease phenotype are</span> <span m='1083000'>governed
  by the alleles, by the SNPs, by the polymorphisms</span> <span m='1087000'>that
  we carry, and obviously by the genes and</span> <span m='1091000'>proteins that
  we make. So let's begin to imagine,</span> <span m='1095000'>let's put ourselves
  fast-forward ten years and begin to imagine where</span> <span m='1099000'>this
  is going to take us. We already know about a very</span> <span m='1102000'>substantial
  number of genes that determine the risk of different</span> <span m='1106000'>kinds
  of cancer, i.e., there's at least 15 different</span> <span m='1110000'>cancer syndromes
  that people have which have been associated with</span> <span m='1114000'>specific
  genetic loci. I talked briefly about retinal</span> <span m='1118000'>blastoma,
  which is a rare one, but even commonly occurring cancers</span> <span m='1122000'>will
  soon be connected with specific alleles in the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='1126000'>And
  the risk of getting them in one's lifetime will be relatively</span> <span m='1130000'>accurately
  predictable. It might take another decade but it</span> <span m='1134000'>will happen.
  Manic depressiveness,</span> <span m='1138000'>some people have great swings in
  mood. 2% or 3% of the population</span> <span m='1142000'>doesn't wake up happy
  every morning. And this is also, I believe, going</span> <span m='1147000'>to yield
  two specific analyses and association with certain genes.</span> </p><p><span m='1151000'>There's
  already a suggestion that the D4 dopamine receptor,</span> <span m='1155000'>which
  is involved in receiving one of the neurotransmitters in the</span> <span m='1160000'>brain,
  may have a polymorphism that's connected with manic</span> <span m='1164000'>depressiveness.
  There will be probably alleles which</span> <span m='1169000'>are connected with,
  in some way, novelty or adventure</span> <span m='1173000'>seeking. There are going
  to be alleles that are associated with</span> <span m='1177000'>anxiety, probably
  maybe connected with the serotonin transporter in</span> <span m='1181000'>the brain.
  Cardiac disease susceptibility is already mapped out</span> <span m='1185000'>in
  a number of traits in the most extreme cases,</span> <span m='1189000'>but cardiac
  disease is very frequent in this population.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>And
  there undoubtedly will be alleles that are discovered that</span> <span m='1197000'>determine
  whether one has a high risk or low risk of getting heart</span> <span m='1201000'>disease,
  of getting arthrosclerosis, and whether or not one can go to</span> <span m='1205000'>McDonald's
  every day and Big Macs with impunity.</span> </p><p><span m='1210000'>Can one do
  that or not? Some people probably can.</span> </p><p><span m='1213000'>Some people
  can eat as much salt as they want and it doesn't give them</span> <span m='1217000'>high
  blood pressure. Other people cannot.</span> </p><p><span m='1220000'>We still don't
  really understand that. Schizophrenia is probably</span> <span m='1224000'>also
  very strongly genetically templated, not totally but very</span> <span m='1227000'>strongly.
  Susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis probably also</span> <span m='1231000'>has
  a strong genetic component. Difficulty or ease with which you</span> <span m='1235000'>solve
  math problems probably also will one day be associated with a</span> <span m='1239000'>certain
  number of genetic loci. How many difficulties in learning</span> <span m='1243000'>languages?
  There's already a trait that was discovered in a family in</span> <span m='1247000'>the
  Netherlands, I believe, and they had a very</span> <span m='1251000'>specific grammatical
  defect in the way that they assembled the syntax</span> <span m='1255000'>of sentences
  associated with a certain allele of a certain gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1259000'>Difficulty
  in just adding rows of numbers may also be associated with</span> <span m='1263000'>certain
  combinations of alleles. Now, you will say, well, it's</span> <span m='1267000'>impossible,
  it's inconceivable that these different aspects of cognitive</span> <span m='1271000'>function
  can be associated with a small number of genes.</span> </p><p><span m='1275000'>But
  let me tell you something else. We talked a week ago about the</span> <span m='1279000'>evolution
  of humanity over the last couple hundred thousand years.</span> </p><p><span m='1284000'>And
  the pace with which the human brain has evolved over the last half</span> <span
  m='1288000'>million years, and more recently the last 200,</span> <span m='1292000'>00
  years, has been so frighteningly rapid that the evolution of</span> <span m='1297000'>cognitive
  function and perception in different ways can only have</span> <span m='1301000'>happened
  through the actions of a small number of genes.</span> </p><p><span m='1306000'>If
  one needed to have dozens of genes change in concert in order to</span> <span m='1310000'>acquire
  the penetrating minds that we now have in which our ancestors</span> <span m='1315000'>500,000
  years didn't have, the evolution could not have</span> <span m='1319000'>occurred
  so quickly. And, for that reason alone,</span> <span m='1324000'>one begins to suspect
  that the genetic differences between people</span> <span m='1328000'>who lived 500,
  00 years ago visa vie their</span> <span m='1333000'>cognitive function and ours
  are not so large. And,</span> <span m='1338000'>therefore, a rather small number
  of genes may have been responsible for</span> <span m='1342000'>conferring on us
  the powerful minds which we now, which most of us,</span> <span m='1347000'>I didn't
  say anything, which most of us now possess.</span> </p><p><span m='1352000'>So where
  is this going to take us? What are the consequences of this?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1356000'>Let's imagine ten or twenty years down the road when we can do some</span>
  <span m='1361000'>kind of SNP analysis on one of these chips that have been developed
  in</span> <span m='1366000'>California and here and in various places. And we can
  begin to imagine</span> <span m='1370000'>the allelic diversity in a newborn child's
  DNA or even prenatally</span> <span m='1375000'>if you want. So what are you going
  to do if you</span> <span m='1380000'>begin to find on a chip of a child's DNA that
  this kid is likely to be</span> <span m='1384000'>very good in language, probably
  is going to have poor math</span> <span m='1388000'>skills, will be a rather anxious
  and obsessive person,</span> <span m='1392000'>will have difficulty associating
  with his or her peers,</span> <span m='1397000'>and is likely to come down with
  heart disease at the age of 45?</span> </p><p><span m='1401000'>How is that going
  to affect your relationship to that</span> <span m='1405000'>person, that child?
  And will you give that child a</span> <span m='1409000'>different kind of education
  than a newborn who has SNPs which indicate</span> <span m='1413000'>that without
  doubt they're going to get 1600s on their morning boards</span> <span m='1417000'>and
  their shoe-ins for admission to MIT? Are you going to treat those</span> <span m='1421000'>kids
  the same or are you going to treat them differently?</span> </p><p><span m='1424000'>Do
  you give them the same kind of education and nurturing?</span> </p><p><span m='1428000'>And
  how do you treat them throughout their elementary and high</span> <span m='1432000'>school?
  Are you going to segregate them into different groups or is</span> <span m='1436000'>everybody
  going to be given an equal chance?</span> </p><p><span m='1440000'>Well, you might
  say it's our tradition in this country to give</span> <span m='1444000'>everybody
  equal footing, in part because of a reaction to</span> <span m='1448000'>what happened
  in World War II in no small part. But what if the time</span> <span m='1453000'>comes
  when people say we need to be more efficient economically in this</span> <span m='1457000'>country
  and we need to devote our resources, need to maximize the</span> <span m='1461000'>investment,
  the benefit we get from various investments,</span> <span m='1466000'>and so it's
  much more efficient to put kids in a certain genetic class</span> <span m='1470000'>in
  one school and kids who have another level of genetic giftedness</span> <span m='1474000'>in
  another school? Of course much of this will be</span> <span m='1478000'>foolhardy
  because all of these genetic tests,</span> <span m='1482000'>although they will
  give you probabilities of certain phenotypes,</span> <span m='1485000'>they'll never,
  at least for the foreseeable generation or two give</span> <span m='1489000'>you
  certainties. No one will be able to predict with</span> <span m='1492000'>absolute
  total certainty about the potentials of one or another young</span> <span m='1496000'>person
  on the basis of DNA tests, at least not in the near future.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1500000'>Right now one can predict with total certainty that somebody who has
  a</span> <span m='1504000'>certain allele will come down with Huntington's disease
  at the age of</span> <span m='1508000'>30 or 40 or 50. There the predictability,</span>
  <span m='1512000'>the penitence is 100%. But what if somebody has an allele that
  says</span> <span m='1516000'>with 60% likelihood they're not going to very good
  at math?</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>Is that already going to be enough to justify
  their segregation amongst</span> <span m='1524000'>a group of the mathematically
  less gifted?</span> </p><p><span m='1529000'>Let's say that they've gone through
  elementary and secondary education</span> <span m='1533000'>and high school and
  they've made it through college and they start</span> <span m='1537000'>looking
  for employment. Actually, there are jobs out here</span> <span m='1541000'>to be
  had in this economy, you wouldn't know it, but there</span> <span m='1545000'>actually
  are people who can find jobs. And let's say one has now an</span> <span m='1549000'>employer
  who is evaluating a certain job candidate for employability.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1553000'>Maybe they'd like to have a good medical checkup before they employ</span>
  <span m='1557000'>this person ostensively to see whether this person is healthy</span>
  <span m='1561000'>enough to last for ten or twenty or thirty years of employment.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1565000'>And maybe they'd like to include among that medical exam
  that</span> <span m='1569000'>person's DNA just in case. And what if the DNA tells
  the</span> <span m='1573000'>employer that this individual is likely to get colon
  cancer in 18</span> <span m='1577000'>years and has a slight susceptibility to mood
  instability</span> <span m='1581000'>and perhaps even manic depressiveness,</span>
  <span m='1585000'>that this person is not one of those who can go to McDonald's
  and eat Big</span> <span m='1589000'>Macs with impunity but has a tendency to arthrosclerosis?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1594000'>You can think of whatever possibilities you will.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1597000'>Will that be, therefore, a ground to reject that person
  as an</span> <span m='1601000'>employee? Well, you'll say they really have no right</span>
  <span m='1605000'>to do that. But keep in mind that with increasing frequency in
  this</span> <span m='1609000'>society medical benefits, medical insurance is paid
  by the</span> <span m='1613000'>employer. So does the employer want to have a whole
  workforce of people</span> <span m='1617000'>who are in various stages of terminal
  disease or would this</span> <span m='1621000'>employer like to be able to pay the
  lowest possible health benefits</span> <span m='1625000'>because the employer has
  taken care to employ only people who have a</span> <span m='1629000'>really terrific
  genotype, whatever that is defined as being</span> <span m='1633000'>arbitrarily
  admittedly? And what about marriagability?</span> </p><p><span m='1637000'>As my
  sister always says to me, if you want to marry a man the first</span> <span m='1641000'>thing
  you should do is look into his genes. That's a double</span> <span m='1645000'>entendre.
  Anyhow.</span> </p><p><span m='1654000'>See, somebody finally got it. [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='1655000'>The fact is that maybe certain</span> <span m='1664000'>people
  will be deemed to be less desirable genetically.</span> </p><p><span m='1669000'>Well,
  the fact is we've been doing that for the last million years.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1674000'>If you're attracted to someone and you end up marrying them then they</span>
  <span m='1679000'>have phenotypes which you think are in one way or another valuable.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1684000'>Consciously or unconsciously, you are practicing a form
  of</span> <span m='1688000'>eugenics. But obviously there could be a much more subtle
  form of</span> <span m='1692000'>eugenics where part of the marriage contract states
  that you want a</span> <span m='1696000'>sample of that person's buccal swab or
  some lymphocytes to check out</span> <span m='1700000'>what kind of DNA he or she
  has. Now you say, well, that could never</span> <span m='1704000'>happen. But it
  happens today regularly.</span> </p><p><span m='1709000'>There are villages in Greece
  where there are a substantial percentage</span> <span m='1712000'>of people who
  carry the trait sickle cell anemia which,</span> <span m='1716000'>as you may know,
  is not so serious phenotypically in heterozygous form,</span> <span m='1720000'>but
  in the homozygous form is actually devastating.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>And
  the reason they have sickle cell anemia is that those areas of</span> <span m='1727000'>Greece
  historically had high rates of malaria. And,</span> <span m='1731000'>as you may
  know, sickle cell anemia actually protects,</span> <span m='1735000'>in the heterozygous
  state actually protects one from the ravages of the</span> <span m='1739000'>malarial
  parasite. So about 20 years ago it became</span> <span m='1743000'>possible to do
  a simple genetic test to determine whether an individual</span> <span m='1747000'>was
  heterozygous for sickle cell anemia. And what happened is that</span> <span m='1751000'>somehow
  what was supposed to be confidential medical genetic tests</span> <span m='1755000'>got
  out. They became public. And young individuals in the</span> <span m='1759000'>population
  became known as carrier, as heterozygotes for sickle cell</span> <span m='1763000'>trait,
  even though phenotypically they were reasonably normal because</span> <span m='1767000'>the
  heterozygote condition is not so devastating.</span> </p><p><span m='1772000'>So
  those individuals were soon ostracized, to use an old Greek word.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1776000'>They were soon put to the side. They were placed in the pool of the</span>
  <span m='1780000'>unmarriable because nobody wanted to marry them. And so they then,</span>
  <span m='1784000'>as a consequence, began to marry amongst themselves.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1789000'>Remember what I told you about homozygosis with the sickle cell</span>
  <span m='1793000'>trait. But that's only one example of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1798000'>Among Orthodox Jews, among Ashkenazi Jews between 2% and</span> <span
  m='1801000'>3% of the population carries an allele for Tay-Sachs disease which</span>
  <span m='1805000'>is phenotypically silent in the heterozygous state but in the</span>
  <span m='1809000'>homozygous state is a devastating condition which leads to death
  in</span> <span m='1813000'>the first years of life. So now among the Orthodox Jews
  in</span> <span m='1817000'>New York before two young people will get married they
  will do a test</span> <span m='1821000'>to see whether they are heterozygous for
  the Ta Sacks allele.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>And, in fact, it's not limited
  any longer to Orthodox Jews.</span> </p><p><span m='1829000'>Because if they're
  both heterozygotes their marriage to one</span> <span m='1832000'>another, in spite
  of anything else they consider,</span> <span m='1836000'>is strongly discouraged.
  Among those who don't live in such</span> <span m='1840000'>a closely structured
  society such people might nonetheless decide to</span> <span m='1843000'>get married
  and then face the devastating possibility of one of</span> <span m='1847000'>their
  four offspring on average coming out as a homozygote and</span> <span m='1851000'>having
  an incurable genetic disease which is going to lead</span> <span m='1855000'>to
  their early death. But what about other traits?</span> </p><p><span m='1859000'>And
  what time will this genetic discrimination,</span> <span m='1863000'>where will
  it begin and where will it end? What if you find an</span> <span m='1867000'>individual
  who has a trait of manic depressiveness among relatives?</span> </p><p><span m='1872000'>And
  when will these genetic tests become public?</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>When
  will they be private knowledge? You say, well,</span> <span m='1880000'>they can
  all be kept private. But ultimately there are already</span> <span m='1885000'>insurance
  companies which are demanding to determine whether and</span> <span m='1889000'>individual
  can be insured by looking at whether they have genes for</span> <span m='1893000'>certain
  kinds of disease-causing alleles.</span> </p><p><span m='1898000'>After all, why
  should they insure somebody, give somebody life</span> <span m='1902000'>insurance
  if they are likely to come down with Huntington's disease at</span> <span m='1906000'>the
  age between 35 and 40, which will surely and inevitably</span> <span m='1910000'>lead
  them to an early grave? You'll say, well, we cannot have</span> <span m='1914000'>genetic
  information like that become public or even become accessible.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1918000'>Maybe that's a solution. The problem is we've been talking</span> <span
  m='1922000'>about these issues for 10 to 15 years in this society,</span> <span
  m='1926000'>and we've not yet converged any kind of solution. And the solutions
  to</span> <span m='1930000'>these problems should not be left in the hands of molecular
  biologists,</span> <span m='1934000'>because molecular biologists or biologically
  cognizant people by now,</span> <span m='1938000'>like you, are no more gifted and
  no more insightful to deal with these</span> <span m='1943000'>issues than anyone
  else is. They're intuitively obvious these</span> <span m='1947000'>issues. You
  don't need to know about SNPs to begin to understand</span> <span m='1951000'>the
  potentially devastating impacts that the misuse of genetics can have</span> <span
  m='1955000'>on our society. And what happens if one of these</span> <span m='1960000'>days
  people discover alleles for certain aspects of cognitive</span> <span m='1964000'>function?
  Chess playing ability. The ability to learn five different</span> <span m='1968000'>languages.
  The ability to remember strings of numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='1972000'>The
  ability to speak extemporaneously in front of a class,</span> <span m='1976000'>for
  what it's worth, for 50 minutes several times a week.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>Whatever
  ability you want,</span> <span m='1985000'>valued or not so valued, what if those
  alleles begin to come out?</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>And here's the worse
  part. What if somebody begins to look for the</span> <span m='1994000'>frequency
  of those alleles in different ethnic groups scattered</span> <span m='1998000'>across
  this planet? Now, you will say to me,</span> <span m='2002000'>well, God has made
  all his children equal. But the fact is if you look</span> <span m='2007000'>at
  the details of human evolution, some of which I discussed with you a</span> <span
  m='2011000'>week ago, last week, you'll come to realize that most</span> <span m='2016000'>populations
  in humanity are the modern descendents of very</span> <span m='2020000'>small founder
  groups. Remember about the story of the Fins.</span> </p><p><span m='2025000'>70%
  of Finish men carry the same Y chromosome. All modern Fins,</span> <span m='2030000'>most
  modern Fins, all of them are likely to be the descendents of a</span> <span m='2035000'>small
  founder group that came into Finland 2,000 or 3,</span> <span m='2040000'>00 years
  ago and carry with them the peculiar set of polymorphisms that</span> <span m='2045000'>founder
  group happens to have had. And arguments like that begin to</span> <span m='2049000'>persuade
  you that there'll be different allele frequencies in</span> <span m='2053000'>different
  populations of humanity. What if somebody begins to discover</span> <span m='2057000'>that
  Macedonians have an enormously high rate of the ability to play</span> <span m='2061000'>chess
  because of a certain allele? And here I'm talking very</span> <span m='2065000'>speculatively.
  I'm not literally meaning that.</span> </p><p><span m='2069000'>And Tibetans have
  a very poor ability to construct software</span> <span m='2073000'>programs because
  of a genetic allele they carry? I hope nobody's Tibetan</span> <span m='2078000'>here.
  I tried to choose two. Are there any Macedonians? All</span> <span m='2082000'>right.
  I succeeded. All right. Anyhow. So the fact is</span> <span m='2087000'>it's inescapable
  that different alleles are going to be present with</span> <span m='2091000'>different
  frequencies in different inbreeding populations of humanity</span> <span m='2096000'>or
  populations of humanity that traditionally have been genetically</span> <span m='2100000'>isolated
  from one another. It's not as if all the genes that we</span> <span m='2105000'>carry
  have been mixed with everybody else's genes freely over the last</span> <span m='2109000'>100,000
  years. Different groups have breed</span> <span m='2113000'>separately and have,
  for reasons that I've told you,</span> <span m='2117000'>founder affects and genetic
  drift acquired different sets and</span> <span m='2121000'>different constellations
  of alleles. So what's going to happen then, I</span> <span m='2125000'>ask you without
  wishing to hear an answer because nobody really knows?</span> </p><p><span m='2129000'>Then
  for the first time there could be a racism which is based not on</span> <span m='2132000'>some
  kind of virulent ideology, not based on some kind of kooky</span> <span m='2136000'>versions
  of genetics, because the eugenicists in the</span> <span m='2140000'>beginning of
  the 20th century, as well as the Nazis hadn't had any</span> <span m='2143000'>idea
  about genetics, they were just using the word,</span> <span m='2147000'>even though
  they knew nothing about the science of genetics as we</span> <span m='2151000'>understand
  it today. But what happens if now for the</span> <span m='2155000'>first time we,
  i.e., you who begin to understand</span> <span m='2158000'>genetics, begin to perceive
  that there are, in fact,</span> <span m='2162000'>different populations of humanity
  that are endowed with different</span> <span m='2166000'>constellation of alleles
  that we imagine are more or less desirable?</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>What's
  going to happen then? I don't know. But some scientists</span> <span m='2173000'>say,
  well, the truth must come out and that everything that can be</span> <span m='2177000'>learned
  should be learned, and we will learn how to digest it</span> <span m='2181000'>and
  we will learn how to live with that. But I'm not so sure that's</span> <span m='2185000'>the
  right thing. And you all have to wrestle with</span> <span m='2189000'>that as well.
  And even more insidious is the</span> <span m='2192000'>following notion. Remember
  the story about the two</span> <span m='2196000'>Jims, the two guys from Ohio who
  met one another at the age of 39 after</span> <span m='2200000'>they'd been separated
  at five weeks of birth? That story begins to</span> <span m='2204000'>persuade you
  of something I said before, and that is that a lot of</span> <span m='2208000'>what
  you think you are isn't what you made of yourself,</span> <span m='2212000'>isn't
  what your parents made of yourself, isn't what your</span> <span m='2216000'>environment
  made of you and your experiences.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>Maybe it's all
  just in your genes. And if that's so then maybe you</span> <span m='2224000'>can't
  take credit for any of the good things you've done.</span> </p><p><span m='2228000'>And
  conversely maybe you're not responsible for all the bad things</span> <span m='2232000'>you've
  done. Maybe three years from now somebody will begin to plead</span> <span m='2236000'>that
  even though they were not criminally insane when they</span> <span m='2240000'>committed
  a string of serial murders, in fact it really wasn't their fault</span> <span m='2244000'>because
  they happen to have this particular genotype which is known</span> <span m='2248000'>to
  be correlated with a strong tendency to violent.</span> </p><p><span m='2252000'>And,
  by the way, there is an allele which has a</span> <span m='2255000'>correlation,
  I forget which one it is, has a correlation with violent</span> <span m='2259000'>behavior.
  So what if one begins to write off everything we do as not a</span> <span m='2263000'>reflection
  of our own freewill, our own volition, but instead a</span> <span m='2266000'>consequence
  of the genes which our parents hoisted on us?</span> </p><p><span m='2270000'>Of
  course, we can blame it on them. As a father of children, I can tell</span> <span
  m='2274000'>you that it's amazing how many different things can be blamed on</span>
  <span m='2278000'>the parents. [LAUGHTER] Of course, the parents have their</span>
  <span m='2282000'>own out. The parents can blame it on their parents.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2286000'>So now it goes back to the grandparents, back to the beginning</span>
  <span m='2290000'>of time. We laugh about these things and they are amusing,</span>
  <span m='2294000'>but they are taking us on a collision course with some very</span>
  <span m='2298000'>difficult problems. And you guys have to wrestle with</span> <span
  m='2302000'>them and you guys have to explain to the people who haven't taken 7.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2306000'>12 where the world of biology is taking us.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2311000'>And on that note, I want to tell you that Eric and I</span> <span m='2315000'>have
  enormously enjoyed being with you this semester.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>We
  wish you much luck and success in your future lives.</span> </p><p><span m='2324000'>We
  hope some of you have become interested in biology and that you</span> <span m='2329000'>found
  this course a little different from what you took in high school.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2333000'>And have a wonderful winter vacation. See you. [APPLAUSE]</span> </p>
