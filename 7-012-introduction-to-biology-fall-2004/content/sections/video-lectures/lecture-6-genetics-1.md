transcript: <p><span m='1000'>I am the other half of the teaching team for 7.01.</span>
  </p><p><span m='3000'>You've already gotten to meet my good colleague Bob Weinberg.</span>
  </p><p><span m='6000'>My name is Eric Lander. And Bob and I are both faculty here
  in the</span> <span m='9000'>Biology Department. In fact, we're both members over
  at</span> <span m='12000'>the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.</span>
  </p><p><span m='15000'>In fact, we just spent the whole weekend together at the
  Whitehead</span> <span m='19000'>Retreat. And so, Bob and I have been doing this</span>
  <span m='22000'>course together for a number of years. And we very much</span> <span
  m='25000'>love it. I am -- I'll take a brief moment and</span> <span m='28000'>introduce
  myself, since I haven't had the opportunity</span> <span m='31000'>to do so yet.
  I am by training, well, actually, I'm really a</span> <span m='35000'>geneticist.
  By training I'm actually a pure mathematician.</span> </p><p><span m='38000'>That
  was actually what my undergraduate degree was in,</span> <span m='41000'>and even
  my PhD was in, but then wandered into biology.</span> </p><p><span m='45000'>And
  for the last almost 20 years, I have been doing genetics in some</span> <span m='48000'>form
  or another. So I love genetics and look forward</span> <span m='51000'>to talking
  a lot about genetics. And it's really lovely that my</span> <span m='55000'>first
  lecture today is actually going to be our first introduction</span> <span m='58000'>to
  genetics. I am -- Just for other backgrounds,</span> <span m='61000'>I direct this
  new Broad Institute that is here. And it's actually a</span> <span m='65000'>joint
  institute between MIT and Harvard. And you will know it now</span> <span m='68000'>as
  a hole in the ground next to Legal Seafood.</span> </p><p><span m='72000'>If you
  see a bunch of cranes and things opposite the biology building</span> <span m='75000'>and
  opposite Legal Seafood next to the Whitehead,</span> <span m='79000'>that's the
  Broad Institute. And we have ambition some day to be</span> <span m='83000'>more
  than the hole in the ground but to actually rise above the ground.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86000'>And the Broad is about genomic medicine and using genomes</span> <span
  m='90000'>and things like that. And the Broad Institute includes</span> <span m='93000'>this
  center at MIT that was one of the leading participants in the</span> <span m='96000'>Human
  Genome project. So that's a lot of what I do with</span> <span m='100000'>my day
  job, in addition to teaching, is work on things like the Human</span> <span m='103000'>Genome
  project. And, now that we actually have a</span> <span m='106000'>sequence to the
  human genome, figuring out what in the world it</span> <span m='109000'>all means.
  And I hope I'll get a chance to tell you,</span> <span m='113000'>during the course
  of this class, about the human genome and about</span> <span m='116000'>what's in
  it and things like that. Like I say, that's one of the things</span> <span m='119000'>I
  tremendously love about teaching biology as opposed,</span> <span m='122000'>if
  I can get in trouble, to any of the other required</span> <span m='125000'>introductory
  courses, is that our curriculum changes every</span> <span m='129000'>year because
  the field is moving so rapidly. I look back at what we</span> <span m='132000'>taught
  ten years ago in this course, because I've been teaching it that</span> <span m='135000'>long,
  and all sorts of open questions now we know the answers to</span> <span m='138000'>and
  are part of the curriculum. Some of the things we thought we</span> <span m='141000'>knew
  we now know are false and we know new things.</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>And
  every year we get to introduce new stuff.</span> </p><p><span m='148000'>And I know,
  I mean with all due respect to calculus,</span> <span m='152000'>it's just not the
  case for calculus that there's anything really new to</span> <span m='157000'>introduce.
  Most of it sort of settled down about three or four</span> <span m='162000'>centuries
  ago. And, you know,</span> <span m='167000'>that's just not the case with what we
  do. Anyway,</span> <span m='172000'>so that's why I love it. All right. So Bob has
  been talking</span> <span m='177000'>to you about biochemistry largely. And I'm
  going to now turn to</span> <span m='182000'>genetics. But I want you to understand
  that that is an</span> <span m='186000'>overarching framework that explains how
  all the materials you're going</span> <span m='191000'>to see, at least in the first
  half or more of this course fit together.</span> </p><p><span m='195000'>And Bob
  may have mentioned it, but I'm going to mention it again,</span> <span m='200000'>I
  would use this following diagram as kind of our roadmap or subway map</span> <span
  m='204000'>of where we're going in this course. What we really want to do is</span>
  <span m='209000'>understand biological function. That's what we most want. How is</span>
  <span m='213000'>it that an organism is able to breathe in air and distribute it
  to</span> <span m='217000'>its cells? How is it that an organism is able to move
  its muscles?</span> </p><p><span m='221000'>How is it that an organism is able to
  fight off invaders to its body,</span> <span m='225000'>microbes, things like that?
  How is it that an embryo develops into a</span> <span m='230000'>full adult? Zillions
  of questions. That's what I mean by biological</span> <span m='234000'>function.
  The two complimentary approaches to studying biological</span> <span m='238000'>function,
  over the course of the past century or so in biology,</span> <span m='242000'>have
  been the following. There have been the biochemists.</span> </p><p><span m='247000'>Biochemistry
  seeks to break down the organism into individual</span> <span m='251000'>components
  and study them on their own in a test tube.</span> </p><p><span m='255000'>They
  will take an organisms, and to a biochemist wishing to study</span> <span m='259000'>the
  beauty of a butterfly flapping in the wind and understanding all of</span> <span
  m='263000'>the mechanics of how it could possibly flap those wings and all,</span>
  <span m='268000'>he or she would start by taking the butterfly, putting it in the
  blender,</span> <span m='272000'>pressing puree and making an extract, and trying
  to purify individual</span> <span m='276000'>components that would explain muscles
  moving back and</span> <span m='280000'>forth and all that. This is, of course,</span>
  <span m='285000'>a geneticist's point of view, but it's all right. You have Bob</span>
  <span m='290000'>who will represent biochemistry just fine. And they want to purify
  out</span> <span m='295000'>individual components. Individual components away from
  the</span> <span m='300000'>organism. And the most important individual</span> <span
  m='304000'>type of component that they study are proteins because there are</span>
  <span m='307000'>zillions of proteins and they do all sorts of things in the body.</span>
  </p><p><span m='310000'>And so you could say, in some sense, that this whole theme
  of</span> <span m='313000'>biochemistry, which got started at the turn of the 20th
  century,</span> <span m='317000'>really just a few years before the turn of the
  20th century,</span> <span m='320000'>of grinding up an organism, studying its components
  and being</span> <span m='323000'>able to find, for example, I want to understand
  how I can</span> <span m='326000'>digest lunch. Well. Or how yeast can digest the
  sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='330000'>Grind up yeast, fractionate it and find some
  protein that's able to</span> <span m='335000'>digest the sugar all by itself without
  the rest of the organism,</span> <span m='340000'>an enzyme to do that. That's the
  logic of biochemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='345000'>Genetics is the complimentary
  point of view. Genetics is the study of</span> <span m='350000'>organisms minus
  one component. Of course, what I mean by that are</span> <span m='355000'>mutants.
  The geneticist who wants to</span> <span m='359000'>understand the butterflies and
  how the butterfly can fly would isolate</span> <span m='363000'>butterfly strains
  that have lost the ability to fly.</span> </p><p><span m='366000'>And ideally one
  is extremely closely related to the normal</span> <span m='370000'>butterfly, but
  for some reason, ideally due to the mutation of a</span> <span m='373000'>single
  component they're now unable to fly. And the geneticist would</span> <span m='376000'>then
  say, ah-ha, that component must matter an awful</span> <span m='380000'>lot for
  the ability to fly because the butterfly that lacks that</span> <span m='383000'>component
  cannot fly. It's a totally complimentary point</span> <span m='387000'>of view.
  And the objects the geneticists</span> <span m='391000'>study in order to do that
  are genes. Now, what is of course hard for you</span> <span m='395000'>guys to understand
  but will form a structure for some of the lectures</span> <span m='399000'>that
  I'm going to give over the continuing part of this course,</span> <span m='403000'>is
  that through most of the 20th century the folks who studied</span> <span m='407000'>biochemistry
  and tried to understand proteins and the folks who studied</span> <span m='411000'>genetics
  and tried to understand mutants had nothing to say to each</span> <span m='415000'>other.
  They didn't speak the same language.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>They had nothing
  to relate to each other by because there was no idea</span> <span m='424000'>of
  how this gene stuff, which started as a totally abstract</span> <span m='429000'>business,
  could possibly relate to this protein stuff which started as</span> <span m='434000'>a
  very practical in the test-tube thing. And they went for a very</span> <span m='439000'>long
  time as if they were just ships sailing in the dark unaware of each</span> <span
  m='443000'>other. And I exaggerate, but it's more true than not.</span> </p><p><span
  m='448000'>The great intellectual event was the unification of these two points</span>
  <span m='453000'>of view through the discipline of molecular biology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='458000'>Molecular biology was the discipline that realized,</span> <span m='461000'>oh,
  my goodness, these are two different sides of the</span> <span m='465000'>same coin.
  That, in fact, genes encode proteins,</span> <span m='468000'>proteins are encoded
  by genes. Ah-ha. This was a wonderful and</span> <span m='472000'>important thunder
  clap in the 20th century. Now,</span> <span m='476000'>it was a theoretical piece
  of information at first.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>The idea that genes and
  proteins were related in this way was</span> <span m='484000'>abstract, very important,
  but you couldn't do anything really</span> <span m='488000'>with it, because it
  turned out you couldn't actually work with</span> <span m='492000'>individual genes.
  The next great revolution of the</span> <span m='496000'>20th century was a technological
  revolution that let you actually</span> <span m='500000'>work with genes. And that
  was the recombinant DNA</span> <span m='504000'>revolution in which the tools to
  be able to study genes on their own</span> <span m='508000'>away from the organism,
  study proteins, use genes to figure</span> <span m='512000'>out what protein they
  encode, given a protein and figure out what</span> <span m='517000'>the gene is,
  given a gene and actually go in and make a mutant in</span> <span m='521000'>it,
  not wait for a random one to rise in the lab but deliberately</span> <span m='525000'>knock
  it out, all of that operationalized this intellectual</span> <span m='530000'>procedure,
  this intellectual framework. So that is,</span> <span m='534000'>in some sense,
  a roadmap to coming lectures that I'm going to give.</span> </p><p><span m='539000'>I'm
  going to talk about genetics, I'm going to talk about molecular</span> <span m='542000'>biology,
  and I'm going to talk about recombinant DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='545000'>That's
  the structure of the next several weeks of this course.</span> </p><p><span m='548000'>And
  what I want you to do is to recognize that although we're going</span> <span m='551000'>to
  dive down into the individual components of it,</span> <span m='554000'>everything
  we're going to do over the coming weeks fits into this very</span> <span m='557000'>amazing
  intellectual framework. And this is the intellectual</span> <span m='560000'>framework
  that you inherit as the new students coming into this field</span> <span m='563000'>and
  going into the 21st century is all this was worked out</span> <span m='566000'>in
  the last century. You now have an understanding of how</span> <span m='569000'>all
  these pieces fit together, or at least you will, how these can</span> <span m='572000'>be
  used to study biological function and, as I will also talk about,</span> <span m='576000'>the
  recombinant DNA has grown into a world of genomics that has given us</span> <span
  m='579000'>the complete picture of all of the components. It's actually not bad.</span>
  </p><p><span m='582000'>You were very wise to have shown up when you did because
  an awful lot of</span> <span m='585000'>that groundwork has now been laid. You know,
  if you would have come</span> <span m='588000'>along 50 years earlier, you know,
  all that would have been</span> <span m='592000'>slogged through. Right now you
  have this laid out</span> <span m='595000'>for you very nicely. And that's sort
  of what the theme</span> <span m='598000'>will be. OK? I would ask are there any
  questions,</span> <span m='602000'>but there should be a zillion questions about
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='607000'>This is just intended as a framework there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='611000'>So let's now dive in. Section 1. And I'll give a bit</span>
  <span m='616000'>more background today than I will in some of the other lectures,</span>
  <span m='621000'>but we've got to get going. What I really want to do first is talk</span>
  <span m='626000'>about, in fact, most of today will be about Mendel.</span> </p><p><span
  m='631000'>I confess, Mendel is my hero. He is one of my absolute heroes in</span>
  <span m='634000'>science. I just love Mendel. And so I'll dwell on him a little</span>
  <span m='638000'>bit today. Now, here's the problem with trying to</span> <span
  m='642000'>tell you about Mendel. You already know about Mendel,</span> <span m='646000'>right?
  Who here hasn't met Mendel and the peas and the stuff and all</span> <span m='649000'>that
  in their high school textbooks? So what am I doing talking about</span> <span m='653000'>Mendel
  today? Well, I think what you learn about Mendel</span> <span m='657000'>in the
  textbooks in high school does not really bring out what really</span> <span m='661000'>went
  on with Mendel's thinking, what's really important about those</span> <span m='665000'>experiments,
  what's really interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>And so I want to ask you
  to put aside what you think you know about</span> <span m='673000'>Mendel and let's
  go back over the setting of who Mendel was,</span> <span m='677000'>what he was
  doing, how it all adds up. Because I think in Mendel you</span> <span m='681000'>can
  find just the seeds of how to do great science.</span> </p><p><span m='685000'>Now,
  for starters let me clear up, I'll take five minutes to clear up,</span> <span m='689000'>four
  minutes to clear up some misconceptions about Mendel.</span> </p><p><span m='693000'>It
  has generally been written that Mendel was this monk working in this</span> <span
  m='697000'>monastery often in the Chez Republic, at that point in the</span> <span
  m='701000'>Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he was isolated, working by</span> <span
  m='705000'>himself, and it was amazing he discovered all this stuff.</span> </p><p><span
  m='710000'>It's nonsense. Mendel working on genetics was no accident.</span> </p><p><span
  m='714000'>It was the result of extraordinary historical and economic forces over</span>
  <span m='718000'>the course of about three centuries that culminated Mendel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='723000'>Let me briefly explain why. It starts with the Age of</span>
  <span m='726000'>Exploration. Europe starts sending out boats around the world,</span>
  <span m='729000'>explorers to meet other parts of the world in the 1500s.</span>
  </p><p><span m='732000'>The boats come back. They bring back stories of amazing</span>
  <span m='736000'>lands. They also bring back odd plants, odd animals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='739000'>People begin to look at these plants and animals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='742000'>They begin to cross them, grow them and cross them, and look</span> <span
  m='745000'>at the weird odd combinations of things that are going on.</span> </p><p><span
  m='749000'>And they say, wow, there's so much more variation out</span> <span m='752000'>in
  the world than we thought about. Some of it's kind of useful. We</span> <span m='756000'>can
  make new kinds of varieties of plants different than we had before,</span> <span
  m='759000'>new kinds of varieties of apples. Now, it turns out that's not just an</span>
  <span m='763000'>intellectual curiosity that that was the case because economics
  was</span> <span m='766000'>changing in the face of Europe in the 1600s and in the
  1700s with</span> <span m='770000'>better transportation networks. So if you happen
  to be able to make</span> <span m='774000'>a better apple, it was good, not just
  for your</span> <span m='777000'>family, but you would be able to project that through
  lines of</span> <span m='781000'>distribution to larger markets. It became economically
  sensible to</span> <span m='785000'>invest your efforts in producing a better crop
  because you could sell</span> <span m='789000'>it to more people because unified
  markets and transportation systems</span> <span m='793000'>were developing across
  Europe. And, therefore, economic forces</span> <span m='797000'>began to work toward
  getting a hold on the understanding of how you</span> <span m='801000'>could do
  better breeding. Now, this turned out to be</span> <span m='805000'>particularly
  important to the folks in Central Europe in the</span> <span m='809000'>Austro-Hungarian
  Empire, which was the center of the textile</span> <span m='813000'>industry. They
  were particularly concerned,</span> <span m='816000'>in the late 1700s, about the
  fact that as the center of the textile</span> <span m='820000'>industry they had
  to be concerned about the raw materials like wool</span> <span m='823000'>that they
  used. Wool you could get from Central</span> <span m='827000'>Europe, the Spanish
  had begun producing by breeding better sheep</span> <span m='831000'>with better
  wool. This freaked out the guys in the</span> <span m='834000'>Austro-Hungarian
  Empire because they were risking now losing this stuff</span> <span m='838000'>to
  the Spanish because of their better sheep.</span> </p><p><span m='842000'>And they
  began, around 1800, to say we better start</span> <span m='846000'>understanding
  how to do breeding. They put together societies to</span> <span m='850000'>understand
  better the science of inheritance and breeding.</span> </p><p><span m='854000'>By
  1820, a society which was not about sheep but about plants,</span> <span m='858000'>in
  fact, apples and grapes, the Pomological and Enological Society</span> <span m='862000'>of
  Braunau was organized. Braunau being the capital of the</span> <span m='866000'>Austro-Hungarian
  Empire. And this society got all the town</span> <span m='870000'>fathers of Braunau
  together. In those days it was just fathers,</span> <span m='874000'>you know. Together
  in Braunau and started this society to encourage</span> <span m='878000'>the scientific
  study of agricultural inheritance. They had this big</span> <span m='882000'>dinner
  and they were drinking and things, and the speech is actually</span> <span m='886000'>written
  down where the president gets up and says,</span> <span m='890000'>"Some day the
  world may be as indebted as it is to Isaac Newton</span> <span m='894000'>for physics.
  They may be as indebted to the City of Braunau for</span> <span m='898000'>its contributions
  to inheritance." Which is just eerie to read that in</span> <span m='901000'>1820
  in setting up this society. That was their high hopes for what</span> <span m='905000'>they
  would do. In particular,</span> <span m='908000'>the president of this society,
  one CF Nap was president of the</span> <span m='912000'>society as a side job, his
  main job was he was head of the</span> <span m='915000'>Augustinian monastery in
  Braunau. So he began keeping an eye out for</span> <span m='919000'>bright young
  math and physic students. Basically,</span> <span m='923000'>you know, MIT kids
  coming out of high schools. And he identified a</span> <span m='926000'>bunch of
  smart ones and attracted them to the monastery and gave them</span> <span m='930000'>problems
  to work on. He particularly was impressed with</span> <span m='933000'>this relatively
  poor kid, Gregor Mendel, who had been</span> <span m='937000'>floundering around
  with a couple of things, didn't have bright family</span> <span m='940000'>prospects,
  and attracted him to the monastery to work on problems of</span> <span m='944000'>inheritance.
  So this was no accident. This was a biotech</span> <span m='947000'>incubator that
  had been set up in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</span> </p><p><span m='951000'>Not
  of the sort we'd recognize today, but it's just fascinating to</span> <span m='954000'>realize
  Mendel was not in a vacuum at all. He knew what</span> <span m='958000'>he was doing
  here. He really wanted,</span> <span m='961000'>for the good of mankind, to understand
  how to improve</span> <span m='965000'>inheritance. But why do we celebrate Mendel
  today?</span> </p><p><span m='969000'>We celebrate Mendel today because he went
  about it,</span> <span m='973000'>lots of people were interested in this problem,
  right?</span> </p><p><span m='976000'>You could probably find hundreds of people
  who tried to do something on</span> <span m='980000'>this problem. Mendel was different
  because he went about it as a</span> <span m='984000'>scientist. He went about it
  with a rigor and a persistence unlike all</span> <span m='988000'>of his peers at
  the time. So let's think about what it was</span> <span m='992000'>that Mendel did.
  So, anyway, forgive me for the</span> <span m='996000'>historical digression, but
  I think it's interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1000000'>What did Mendel do? Mendel
  started by taking peas.</span> </p><p><span m='1004000'>Now, he went off to the
  market and he got different varieties of peas.</span> </p><p><span m='1009000'>And
  he brought back all of these varieties of peas and he tried</span> <span m='1013000'>growing
  them. Now, actually, although I don't have the</span> <span m='1017000'>records,
  I'm sure he did lots more than peas.</span> </p><p><span m='1022000'>He brought
  probably lots of stuff and he tried growing it.</span> </p><p><span m='1025000'>And
  the first order of question he wanted to ask is if I study</span> <span m='1029000'>inheritance,
  I've got to start with something that has constant</span> <span m='1032000'>properties.
  This seems obvious to you guys, but it was not at all</span> <span m='1036000'>obvious
  at the time that the most important thing you could do,</span> <span m='1040000'>if
  you wanted to understand the transmission of traits and crosses</span> <span m='1043000'>and
  inheritance and all that, is not to set up any crosses. It</span> <span m='1047000'>was
  first to set up your experimental system and make sure it</span> <span m='1051000'>was
  rock solid. He probably devoted years to getting</span> <span m='1055000'>varieties
  of different plants, and in particular settling on peas,</span> <span m='1059000'>with
  a property that when he had peas with different traits,</span> <span m='1064000'>like
  whether or not the pea seed was round or wrinkled,</span> <span m='1068000'>which
  will be some of our favorite traits here, that when you simply</span> <span m='1073000'>selfed
  this plant, crossed it to itself and looked at</span> <span m='1077000'>the next
  generation, it bred true. Hard to emphasize how important that</span> <span m='1082000'>was,
  but this was careful experimental design.</span> </p><p><span m='1088000'>So many
  biological projects fail</span> <span m='1094000'>because people don't take the
  trouble to set up a system that's</span> <span m='1097000'>rock solid. They set
  up a system that's noisy and you're not really</span> <span m='1100000'>sure you're
  going to be able to interpret the data,</span> <span m='1103000'>etc. So Mendel
  did that. Very good.</span> </p><p><span m='1107000'>Always, no matter how long
  you continued to breed these things,</span> <span m='1111000'>you continued to get
  round or you continued to get wrinkled.</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>Now Mendel
  was ready. He was ready to set up his first</span> <span m='1121000'>controlled
  cross.</span> </p><p><span m='1132000'>So what he did was he took a round pea and
  a wrinkled pea and he</span> <span m='1137000'>crossed them together. Now, that's
  again some serious work.</span> </p><p><span m='1141000'>You first have to go along
  to one of the peas, cut off its little</span> <span m='1144000'>pollen producing
  organs so it doesn't self-fertilize because peas</span> <span m='1147000'>will self-fertilize.
  You've got to cut them off early,</span> <span m='1151000'>make sure it doesn't
  get its own pollen on it. Then you go over to</span> <span m='1154000'>the other
  one with a paint brush, you get some pollen and you paint</span> <span m='1157000'>the
  pollen on the first plant. That's how you set up the cross.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1160000'>If you screw it up you could have self-fertilization or the wind could</span>
  <span m='1163000'>carry some pollen from something from somewhere else.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1166000'>So it had to be done very carefully. He set it up.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1170000'>And his first big-time observation was? Now, again,</span> <span m='1175000'>I
  know you know all this, so feel free to chime in. In the</span> <span m='1180000'>next
  generation all the peas were round. We denote generations with</span> <span m='1185000'>an
  F. F stands for filial meaning children. We sometimes denote them</span> <span m='1191000'>with
  a G for generation. Anyway, I tend to use F,</span> <span m='1196000'>and most geneticists
  tend to use F. The parental generation here is</span> <span m='1201000'>called F0,
  the first generation is called F1, the second generation F2,</span> <span m='1205000'>etc.
  So why was this a big deal? This was a huge big deal.</span> </p><p><span m='1210000'>If
  you took a poll, a CNN Gallup poll of Braunau at that time and you</span> <span
  m='1215000'>ask voters what do you think would happen if I cross a round pea to
  a</span> <span m='1219000'>wrinkled pea, what do you think the majority of voters
  would say?</span> </p><p><span m='1224000'>Well, maybe half and half or maybe all
  a little wrinkled,</span> <span m='1229000'>you know, a little puckered or something
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>The notion that one trait would be totally
  dominant over the other</span> <span m='1237000'>trait was by no means the general
  thinking. And you know what?</span> </p><p><span m='1240000'>It wasn't even the
  general case. If you took plants, you guys must</span> <span m='1243000'>know. If
  you take plants and you cross them, the F1 usually looks</span> <span m='1246000'>like
  some kind of a mix. It's some kind of a blend between</span> <span m='1249000'>the
  two. And, of course, that's because you're</span> <span m='1253000'>really looking
  at situations where you're crossing things in which</span> <span m='1256000'>zillions
  of different traits are being inherited and</span> <span m='1259000'>it's a hodgepodge.
  But Mendel had a situation here</span> <span m='1263000'>where he got an absolutely
  crisp dominance of one trait over the</span> <span m='1269000'>other. And so wrinkled
  completely disappears, round dominates,</span> <span m='1275000'>wrinkled disappears
  completely.</span> </p><p><span m='1284000'>Now, next he does another generation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1290000'>He goes to the second generation. And here he does this
  by selfing</span> <span m='1295000'>this plant. That is he simply kind of puts a
  bag over it and lets its</span> <span m='1301000'>own pollen fertilize itself or
  he takes a little brush and he brushes</span> <span m='1307000'>its own pollen onto
  it. And in the next generation his</span> <span m='1313000'>remarkable thing was
  he saw some rounds and some wrinkles.</span> </p><p><span m='1319000'>What was remarkable
  about that?</span> </p><p><span m='1332000'>Wrinkled came back. I thought wrinkled
  was gone.</span> </p><p><span m='1336000'>And it didn't come back in some half-hearted
  way like a little</span> <span m='1339000'>puckered. It came back fully, totally,
  every bit as wrinkled as</span> <span m='1343000'>the parental wrinkled. And the
  rounds were every bit as</span> <span m='1347000'>round. These were discrete traits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1351000'>Wrinkled reappeared, and it reappeared with no loss.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1355000'>No change in the phenotype, no change in the appearance.
  And</span> <span m='1360000'>that was very important because at the time some of
  the predominant</span> <span m='1365000'>models were blending of traits. And you
  would never imagine, if I</span> <span m='1369000'>were to take grape juice and
  water and blend them together to get some</span> <span m='1374000'>kind of pinkish
  thing that I would be able to separate that back out</span> <span m='1379000'>into
  clear water and deep dark grape juice.</span> </p><p><span m='1384000'>But somehow
  this trait had appeared. Thus, the trait was discrete. Big</span> <span m='1389000'>difference.
  Big news. This trait could be found still</span> <span m='1394000'>lurking there.
  It was merely hidden in the first</span> <span m='1399000'>generation. Mendel did
  one other thing, dear to my heart as someone</span> <span m='1404000'>trained as
  a mathematician, he counted. When he counted up the</span> <span m='1409000'>rounds
  and the wrinkles he found what?</span> </p><p><span m='1415000'>Sorry? Three to
  one round to wrinkled? No,</span> <span m='1424000'>it's not. He found 5, 74 to
  1,850. That's what he found.</span> </p><p><span m='1433000'>Now, what do you recognize
  about that?</span> </p><p><span m='1443000'>Three to one? No, it's not. It's 2.96
  to one.</span> </p><p><span m='1449000'>It's not three to one. What's this three
  to one business?</span> </p><p><span m='1456000'>[LAUGHTER] Why isn't there a famous
  2.96 to one rule?</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>No, no, I'm serious. Mendel did
  one more thing. He counted.</span> </p><p><span m='1470000'>And then he did something
  a little bit outrageous.</span> </p><p><span m='1474000'>He intuited. He said although
  the data do not say three to one,</span> <span m='1478000'>notwithstanding your
  textbook, I think the data are trying to tell</span> <span m='1482000'>me it's three
  to one. [LAUGHTER] This is part of science.</span> </p><p><span m='1486000'>I'm
  sorry? Two sig figs, right. You know, this is actually a</span> <span m='1490000'>big
  deal because so many people are unwilling to kind of look at their</span> <span
  m='1494000'>data to say what's the data trying to tell me?</span> </p><p><span m='1499000'>And,
  of course, there are so many people who are too</span> <span m='1502000'>willing
  to look at their data and say what's the data trying to tell</span> <span m='1506000'>me?
  Because you can go off the tracks in both directions.</span> </p><p><span m='1510000'>So
  Mendel tried some experiments, 3.04 to one, 2.91 to one, etc. And</span> <span m='1514000'>occasionally,
  yes? No. How could he?</span> </p><p><span m='1518000'>Nobody had done this. He
  had no textbooks he could</span> <span m='1522000'>consult. So do you think it's
  possible he experimented with other</span> <span m='1526000'>things that didn't
  show these properties and said maybe these are</span> <span m='1530000'>lousy traits
  to work on. I'm getting such good results on</span> <span m='1533000'>wrinkled,
  let's stay with wrinkled for a while. That is an incredible</span> <span m='1536000'>act
  of experimental judgment to know that some problems are too</span> <span m='1539000'>complicated,
  we'll come back to them later. It's not cheating.</span> </p><p><span m='1542000'>You
  get to say this is an interesting problem,</span> <span m='1545000'>I'm going to
  work on it. Not only that. I'll tell you,</span> <span m='1549000'>occasionally
  Mendel did these experiments and he got completely</span> <span m='1552000'>abhorrent
  results. They didn't match three to one at</span> <span m='1555000'>all. You know
  what he did? He threw out the data. Do you know</span> <span m='1558000'>why? No,
  not small sample.</span> </p><p><span m='1561000'>Large numbers. He's sitting there
  in this garden.</span> </p><p><span m='1564000'>You know, I've actually been to
  Mendel's monastery.</span> </p><p><span m='1567000'>He's in the garden in Braunau.
  Remember, he's got to go cut off</span> <span m='1570000'>the little pollen producing
  organs, he's got to paint the stuff. What</span> <span m='1573000'>if he screws
  up? What if the wind blows and stuff</span> <span m='1576000'>like that? If an experiment
  was way off, he had to consider the</span> <span m='1579000'>possibility that he
  just screwed up because he hadn't gotten to it soon</span> <span m='1582000'>enough
  and pollen had blown in and had fertilized his plants.</span> </p><p><span m='1585000'>Now,
  boy, that's a dangerous thing to do, discarding data.</span> </p><p><span m='1588000'>But
  let's be honest. Sometimes experiments screw up.</span> </p><p><span m='1591000'>And
  if an experimentalist hasn't got enough judgment to know that</span> <span m='1594000'>sometimes
  you cannot believe the data you also can go wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>So
  Mendel, who sometimes is accused for cheating for that,</span> <span m='1600000'>it's
  not at all cheating. What you have to do is say,</span> <span m='1603000'>OK, I've
  got a problem here. I'm going to redo this experiment a</span> <span m='1605000'>bunch
  more times. I'm always getting about this three</span> <span m='1608000'>to one
  thing, but occasionally I get something that's way off there and I</span> <span
  m='1611000'>feel comfortable saying that's an error. You can go wrong with that,</span>
  <span m='1614000'>but Mendel exercised very good judgment in excluding that rather</span>
  <span m='1617000'>than trying to muck this all up by saying occasionally I</span>
  <span m='1620000'>get something weird. So I know the textbook summarizes</span>
  <span m='1624000'>this beautiful 3:1 ratio, but so much creativity. First</span>
  <span m='1628000'>discipline of counting and creativity of interpretation went</span>
  <span m='1632000'>into all of this. So in the modern world what would</span> <span
  m='1637000'>Mendel do? In the modern world, upon seeing this three to one result</span>
  <span m='1641000'>which he, I will note, he saw for a couple of other traits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1645000'>Actually, what he did next was he wanted to explain --</span>
  <span m='1650000'>This was also part of his brilliance. He made a model,</span>
  <span m='1656000'>the model of what was going on. Mendel said how can I possibly</span>
  <span m='1662000'>explain this beautiful observation that for round and wrinkled,</span>
  <span m='1668000'>and for other traits, I observe an approximately 3:1 ratio in
  the F0,</span> <span m='1674000'>F1 and F2 generations? Mendel, my heart beats for
  Mendel. Oh.</span> </p><p><span m='1680000'>A mathematician he is. He says let's
  make a very simple</span> <span m='1683000'>model. Let's assume that there are two
  factors of the control</span> <span m='1687000'>inheritance of this trait. I'll
  call them big R and little R.</span> </p><p><span m='1691000'>The round plants have
  big R and big R. They have two copies of this</span> <span m='1695000'>factor that
  controls shape. The wrinkled plant has two copies</span> <span m='1698000'>of the
  factor that control shape, and the copy of the factor they get</span> <span m='1702000'>is
  different. So the flavor here is big R, the flavor here is little R.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1706000'>This has two copies, this has two copies.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>And
  let's assume that this plant transmits one at random of its two</span> <span m='1714000'>factors
  onto the next generation. It will transmit a big R. Let's</span> <span m='1719000'>assume
  that this transmits one of the two at random.</span> </p><p><span m='1723000'>It
  will transmit a little R. And that plant there in the middle</span> <span m='1728000'>will
  be big R over little R. And what will big R over little R</span> <span m='1733000'>be
  as an appearance? How does he know that that's going</span> <span m='1737000'>to
  be round? Sorry? From the result.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>He knows because
  that's what happened. It's not an overwhelming</span> <span m='1746000'>reason.
  But to make the data work he's got to say,</span> <span m='1750000'>well, then this
  must be round. OK? So no points for that. He's</span> <span m='1754000'>just fitting
  the data. Then here, when you self this,</span> <span m='1759000'>the two parental
  gametes transmit either a big R,</span> <span m='1763000'>so we'll put it over here,
  big R, big R, little R, little R,</span> <span m='1767000'>they transmit. And the
  offspring are of that type.</span> </p><p><span m='1774000'>You can either get that.
  Question there?</span> </p><p><span m='1782000'>Could be. So he had some knowledge.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1798000'>But, of course, this is his model.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1801000'>He's entitled to make his model. And you're saying he had good</span>
  <span m='1804000'>reasons to think in these. So everybody knows Mendel's model,</span>
  <span m='1807000'>right? So, now, in the modern world, the minute you've got data
  like this</span> <span m='1810000'>and you've got a model to explain it, what do
  you do?</span> </p><p><span m='1813000'>Publish. So Mendel, let's put Mendel as
  a young</span> <span m='1816000'>assistant professor who is all fired up about these
  results,</span> <span m='1819000'>writes this up for publication in Nature. It's
  a short thousand word</span> <span m='1822000'>letter to Nature, let's say. And
  he races it off,</span> <span m='1825000'>he emails it to the offices of Nature
  in London.</span> </p><p><span m='1829000'>Because he's in Europe, he'll use the
  London office of</span> <span m='1831000'>Nature saying I have this amazing result,
  I did these crosses.</span> </p><p><span m='1834000'>Here are the results here.
  And I have a model that explains the data</span> <span m='1837000'>perfectly. What
  does Nature do? Sorry? Why does it reject it?</span> </p><p><span m='1840000'>Well,
  the first thing he does is sends it out to referees,</span> <span m='1843000'>right?
  The way that scientific publication works is it chooses two</span> <span m='1846000'>or
  three anonymous referees. It sends the paper out anonymously</span> <span m='1849000'>to
  those two or three referees for comment saying we've received this</span> <span
  m='1852000'>interesting paper from this young monk in Austria.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1855000'>What do you think about it? Give us your opinions? Please</span> <span
  m='1858000'>write back in two weeks, etc. So you're the referees.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1861000'>You get Mendel's paper. What do you advise Nature?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1864000'>Publish or not? No. Why not? It's outrageous.</span> </p><p><span m='1868000'>Why?
  It's never been heard of. Yeah, that's great.</span> </p><p><span m='1871000'>But,
  I mean, you sound like a very conservative, you know,</span> <span m='1874000'>you
  cannot write that. You cannot say it's wrong because it's never</span> <span m='1878000'>been
  heard of. Yeah? Regenerate.</span> </p><p><span m='1881000'>It would be wonderful
  if referees could regenerate the result</span> <span m='1884000'>themselves, but
  it's not practical. For one thing, it takes a long time</span> <span m='1888000'>to
  grow peas. They might not have those strains of</span> <span m='1892000'>peas. The
  best test really would be independent replication of this,</span> <span m='1896000'>but
  unfortunately you cannot get the referee to reproduce each result</span> <span m='1900000'>before
  accepting the paper. So you have to go on the own</span> <span m='1904000'>internal
  results of the paper. Has Mendel proved his case for this</span> <span m='1908000'>model?
  How many people vote Mendel has proved his case for the model?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1912000'>He's my hero. How many people vote that he hasn't proved the case?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1916000'>How many people are conscience abstainers? [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='1921000'>OK. Who says he hasn't proved the case? Why? Exactly.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1926000'>I mean, great, the model fits the data. He had the data first and he</span>
  <span m='1931000'>made a model to fit it. Big deal. So you would say?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1936000'>Yes, he should be able to make a variety of predictions.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1941000'>That would be a confirmation of a model, at least the beginning of a</span>
  <span m='1946000'>confirmation of a model is he could make some predictions</span>
  <span m='1951000'>based on a model. But an ex post facto model to</span> <span m='1955000'>explain
  the data you already have, of course you're going to have one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1959000'>It might be a little whacky, but you always make a model to explain</span>
  <span m='1962000'>your data. That's not the hard thing. Now give me some predictions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1966000'>So, guys, give me some predictions. We write back to Mendel
  saying we</span> <span m='1969000'>find the author's work to be of interest, it's
  a provocative and</span> <span m='1973000'>unheard of finding, and it's a fascinating
  model,</span> <span m='1976000'>but it is just a model. We'd like to see some predictions
  verified.</span> </p><p><span m='1980000'>So what would they be? Sorry? Color.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1984000'>Oh, show me more traits. OK. Fine. We want to see more</span>
  <span m='1988000'>traits. In addition to seeing some more traits, and Mendel actually
  did</span> <span m='1992000'>have more traits in the paper. I'm just simplifying
  here. Prove</span> <span m='1996000'>this model. What predictions would you make
  if this model is correct?</span> </p><p><span m='2000000'>Yes? Keep crossing them.
  So tell me what you would do.</span> </p><p><span m='2004000'>Please send him instructions
  here.</span> </p><p><span m='2012000'>OK, so you would like me to cross one of the
  rounds,</span> <span m='2014000'>an F2 round by a wrinkled. What will happen in
  the next</span> <span m='2017000'>generation?</span> </p><p><span m='2025000'>How
  do I do that? I don't have DNA sequencing</span> <span m='2028000'>available or
  anything, so. [LAUGHTER] See what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2031000'>So what
  might happen? What is this round plant here?</span> </p><p><span m='2034000'>What
  might it be? And what are the probabilities of</span> <span m='2038000'>that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2045000'>One-third of the time it will big R, big R. Two-thirds
  of the time it</span> <span m='2050000'>will be big R, little R. If it is big R,</span>
  <span m='2055000'>big R then the offspring will all be what? Round. If,</span> <span
  m='2060000'>on the other hand, it is the case that that's big R,</span> <span m='2065000'>little
  R then the offspring will all be?</span> </p><p><span m='2070000'>They won't be
  all anything. They'll be half round, a 1:1 ratio</span> <span m='2074000'>of round
  to wrinkled. OK? That's an odd prediction that</span> <span m='2078000'>a third
  of the time the offspring from such crosses will all be round</span> <span m='2082000'>and
  two-thirds of the time the offspring will be 50/50 round and</span> <span m='2086000'>wrinkled.
  You wouldn't normally think of that,</span> <span m='2090000'>right? That's the
  kind of thing that has to be done.</span> </p><p><span m='2094000'>And Mendel, of
  course, did crosses like that. I simplified</span> <span m='2098000'>here. This
  is really what Mendel did was</span> <span m='2103000'>demonstrated that all sorts
  of predictions would be satisfied.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>Another prediction
  that Mendel could make, oops.</span> </p><p><span m='2114000'>Stop, stop, stop,
  stop. Which should be wrinkled?</span> </p><p><span m='2119000'>Oh, my goodness.
  Oh, wrinkle that pea. OK. Onward.</span> </p><p><span m='2124000'>Thank you very
  much, Claudette. That's good.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>So he made more and
  more predictions like this. His predictions,</span> <span m='2136000'>for example,
  let's just take that F1 pea, round over wrinkled here.</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>If
  you cross this back with wrinkled then it's pretty simply</span> <span m='2149000'>because
  then always, if this is an F1 as opposed to an F2,</span> <span m='2155000'>you're
  going to get a 50:50 ratio of round to wrinkled.</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>Moreover,
  these rounds, if you cross them back, will still</span> <span m='2166000'>give you
  a 50:50, etc. That's science.</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>That's the heart of
  science, is being able to look at data,</span> <span m='2174000'>intuit what the
  data is trying to tell you, build a model and test a</span> <span m='2178000'>model.
  All of that is in Mendel. OK? So I know you all know Mendel,</span> <span m='2182000'>but
  this Mendel really. OK? Now, some definitions.</span> </p><p><span m='2186000'>I
  need to give you, so Section 2, some definitions.</span> </p><p><span m='2190000'>Because
  I've been skirting around using some words here.</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>OK?
  Number one, the word gene. Gene is one of these factors of</span> <span m='2202000'>inheritance
  controlling a trait.</span> </p><p><span m='2219000'>Mendel didn't use the word
  gene. The word gene came along much later.</span> </p><p><span m='2223000'>The variant
  flavors of a gene, big R and little R, are known as</span> <span m='2227000'>alleles
  from the Greek word meaning other. These are the alternative</span> <span m='2231000'>forms
  of a gene.</span> </p><p><span m='2239000'>It can come in the form big R, little
  R. I might write big A,</span> <span m='2242000'>little A. I might write plus for
  normal and M for mutant.</span> </p><p><span m='2246000'>There are a lot of different
  notations geneticists use for that.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>The word phenotype
  means appearance. The plant was round. The peas were</span> <span m='2258000'>round.
  That's a phenotype. The individual was 7" 7' tall.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>That's
  a phenotype. OK? Those are phenotypes. Genotype means the pair</span> <span m='2275000'>of
  alleles carried by the individual.</span> </p><p><span m='2284000'>Big R, little
  R is a genotype.</span> </p><p><span m='2291000'>Big R, big R is a genotype. Little
  R, little R. Those are genotypes.</span> </p><p><span m='2296000'>An important difference
  between genotype and phenotype.</span> </p><p><span m='2300000'>Other important
  words so that we can actually talk to each other.</span> </p><p><span m='2305000'>Homozygous
  or homozygote. A homozygote is an individual who</span> <span m='2311000'>has a
  genotype that has two of the same alleles. Two copies of the</span> <span m='2318000'>same
  allele, the individual is said to be homozygous.</span> </p><p><span m='2325000'>And,
  alternatively, an individual is said to be</span> <span m='2332000'>heterozygous,
  heterozygote if they have two alternatives.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>A couple
  of other important definitions.</span> </p><p><span m='2343000'>Dominant.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2351000'>A phenotype round is said to be</span> <span m='2358000'>dominant
  over a phenotype wrinkled if what? If the heterozygote shows</span> <span m='2363000'>that
  phenotype, the heterozygote between pure</span> <span m='2369000'>breeding strains.
  So phenotype one,</span> <span m='2379000'>pheno one is dominant over phenotype
  two if the F1 of pure breeding</span> <span m='2393000'>strains shows phenotype
  one. Similarly, we have the word</span> <span m='2402000'>recessive. Now, I'll mention,
  and you will then</span> <span m='2406000'>proceed to promptly forget, because all
  of my colleagues forget,</span> <span m='2410000'>dominant and recessive do not
  refer to alleles. Big R is not dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='2414000'>Round is
  dominant. Big R is an allele. Now, you say who cares?</span> </p><p><span m='2418000'>The
  textbooks get this wrong all the time, it's true.</span> </p><p><span m='2422000'>You
  won't even find the textbooks use this correctly.</span> </p><p><span m='2426000'>They
  will tell you big R is dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='2430000'>What if it turned
  out that big R controlled three different traits?</span> </p><p><span m='2434000'>Maybe
  roundness. An ability to grow with low salt in the soil.</span> </p><p><span m='2438000'>An
  ability to bloom in May. Some of those traits might be recessive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2442000'>Some of them might be dominant. We know examples of that,</span> <span
  m='2447000'>where the same allele can control multiple traits,</span> <span m='2451000'>some
  of which show dominance, some of which show recessiveness.</span> </p><p><span m='2455000'>So
  real card-carrying geneticists try hard to use the word dominant</span> <span m='2459000'>and
  recessive to refer to phenotypes, not to alleles or genotypes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2464000'>Now, since 80% of the facility in the Biology Department don't use the</span>
  <span m='2467000'>word with that degree of precision, I don't have high hope that
  you will</span> <span m='2470000'>either. But I'm going to try to say the words
  dominant and recessive</span> <span m='2473000'>refer to phenotypes. OK? This is
  a geneticists' kind of</span> <span m='2476000'>hang-up. We all have our shtick,
  but this one of mine, is that these</span> <span m='2479000'>really do refer to
  phenotypes. And it's quite important because</span> <span m='2482000'>otherwise
  you could get quite bollixed up. And I'll come to a</span> <span m='2485000'>case
  with sickle cell anemia where you won't be able to describe the</span> <span m='2488000'>sickle
  cell anemia allele as recessive, dominant or co-dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='2492000'>OK?
  Good. Those are some definitions. They're worth knowing.</span> </p><p><span m='2496000'>If
  we get those definitions right the rest of it is pretty</span> <span m='2501000'>easy.
  All right.</span> </p><p><span m='2513000'>So Mendel publishes this paper in 1865.
  It's accepted.</span> </p><p><span m='2516000'>It appears not in Nature but in the
  proceeding the Royal Academy of</span> <span m='2519000'>Braunau and it's published.
  And what happens?</span> </p><p><span m='2522000'>Nothing. It sinks like a stone.
  Mendel's paper is totally ignored.</span> </p><p><span m='2525000'>Nobody really
  pays any attention to it. This paper was sent to many</span> <span m='2529000'>people.
  Charles Darwin has a copy of Mendel's papers in his files.</span> </p><p><span m='2532000'>But,
  in those days, the way printing worked,</span> <span m='2535000'>in order to read
  a book you had to slit the pages open.</span> </p><p><span m='2539000'>Darwin never
  slit the pages of Mendel's paper,</span> <span m='2542000'>so it's pretty clear
  he never read the paper, even though it had the</span> <span m='2545000'>answer
  to much of what he wanted to know about evolution.</span> </p><p><span m='2549000'>No
  one really read Mendel's paper because it was so far ahead of its</span> <span m='2552000'>time,
  it just was pretty strange. It had all these concepts. And,</span> <span m='2555000'>anyway,
  you could always dismiss it with that kiss of death of biology</span> <span m='2559000'>"it's
  just the model". Right? You can kill things with</span> <span m='2562000'>"it's
  just the model". People were just not prepared to</span> <span m='2566000'>deal
  with Mendel. So Mendel, in fact,</span> <span m='2569000'>poor Mendel, maybe he
  had a good time, I don't think,</span> <span m='2572000'>instead didn't really do
  much more on this topic of genetics per se.</span> </p><p><span m='2576000'>He became
  an administrator. Became abbot of the monastery and</span> <span m='2580000'>did
  other things. Worked on meteorology,</span> <span m='2585000'>etc. And we don't
  really hear from Mendel again. So what really begins</span> <span m='2591000'>to
  reignite interest in this is the understanding in the late 1800s of</span> <span
  m='2596000'>chromosomes. Very briefly, cytologists, people studying cells</span>
  <span m='2601000'>in the microscope. Cytologists are folks who study</span> <span
  m='2607000'>cells. They noticed these very funny little</span> <span m='2614000'>structures
  in cells. They noticed these structures that</span> <span m='2622000'>when you stain
  then with a dye would stain very funny.</span> </p><p><span m='2630000'>They picked
  up dye in a certain way. And they noticed that they had this</span> <span m='2638000'>very
  interesting choreography that when a cell underwent mitosis these</span> <span m='2646000'>funny
  things would divide down the midline and these little x-shaped</span> <span m='2654000'>structures
  would go to the two daughter cells like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2662000'>That
  is these Xs would become single</span> <span m='2668000'>individual pieces. Again,
  you know about these things.</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>They had no clue what
  these were. What is the appropriate scientific</span> <span m='2676000'>procedure
  when you have no clue what something is? You need to give it a</span> <span m='2681000'>name
  that somewhat covers up the fact that you have no clue what</span> <span m='2686000'>you're
  talking about because it sounds much better than just saying</span> <span m='2690000'>they
  are "these funny things". And so they were referred to as</span> <span m='2695000'>chromosomes,
  meaning literally colored things. [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='2700000'>You need to
  understand these sorts</span> <span m='2708000'>of things. OK? So these chromosomes
  here,</span> <span m='2712000'>these colored things, for lack of any other knowledge
  of them,</span> <span m='2716000'>that was the property they could be given. Chromosomes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2719000'>Look it up. They executed this very interesting choreography
  during</span> <span m='2723000'>mitosis. That is cell division. Oh, boy, is that
  going to be noisy.</span> </p><p><span m='2727000'>Someone should shoot it and put
  it</span> <span m='2737000'>out of its misery. [LAUGHTER] All right.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2741000'>But what they then noticed was the following. And we're going to run</span>
  <span m='2745000'>just a couple of minutes over. I'm going to keep it short. But</span>
  <span m='2750000'>they noticed that when organisms made sperm and eggs rather than</span>
  <span m='2754000'>normal cell division, they noticed that these chromosomes,</span>
  <span m='2758000'>instead of all of them lining up on the midline, lined up in pairs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2763000'>And the pairs underwent a series of two divisions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2769000'>There was a first division which we call meiosis one in
  which --</span> <span m='2776000'>-- one copy of each of these Xs went</span> <span
  m='2786000'>to each daughter cell. Very different than mitosis where</span> <span
  m='2792000'>the Xs would be split down the middle. Then a second division</span>
  <span m='2799000'>occurred, meiosis two. And in that each of the daughter</span>
  <span m='2807000'>cells now the X is divided.</span> </p><p><span m='2817000'>And
  they got that. This one looked,</span> <span m='2821000'>for all the world, like
  mitosis. But instead,</span> <span m='2825000'>at the end of the day instead of
  ending up with four chromosomes,</span> <span m='2830000'>here we end up with only
  two chromosomes in each gamete,</span> <span m='2835000'>sperm or eggs. And what
  happened was from this pair,</span> <span m='2839000'>one member of the pair was
  selected. Now, this is either producing sperm</span> <span m='2844000'>or eggs.
  When a sperm like that came together</span> <span m='2849000'>with an egg like that
  and fertilization occurred,</span> <span m='2855000'>you get back to four chromosomes.
  You all know this. You learned</span> <span m='2861000'>this in high school. But
  the important point about this</span> <span m='2867000'>was that people said, ha,
  things lining up in pairs,</span> <span m='2873000'>one copy of each going to the
  offspring, then a copy from mom and</span> <span m='2879000'>a copy from dad restoring
  the pair. Sounds just like what that dead monk</span> <span m='2883000'>was talking
  about. [LAUGHTER] It was just the reason</span> <span m='2887000'>people really
  didn't think much of Mendel's paper was because it was so</span> <span m='2891000'>abstract.
  What were these genes? He didn't point to anything. There</span> <span m='2895000'>was
  nothing concrete. And folks hate that. By contrast</span> <span m='2898000'>they
  now began to see things and vaguely remembered that this was</span> <span m='2902000'>just
  like what Mendel's story was about. And three different groups</span> <span m='2906000'>around
  the world began to redo this work on crosses and all that.</span> </p><p><span m='2910000'>And
  wonderfully in 1900 three groups simultaneously published papers</span> <span m='2915000'>about
  this. Now, Mendel's Law is rediscovered.</span> </p><p><span m='2920000'>Now, the
  explanation here. How does the cytological observations</span> <span m='2926000'>about
  meiosis explain Mendel's laws of inheritance of traits?</span> </p><p><span m='2931000'>Very
  simply. All you have to imagine is that big R is being</span> <span m='2937000'>carried
  on one of these chromosomes. Little R on the other one.</span> </p><p><span m='2943000'>And
  then half the offspring had big R, half the offspring had little R.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2949000'>All of Mendel's laws can be implemented by simply assuming that</span>
  <span m='2955000'>genes and the alleles of those genes live on these chromosomes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2961000'>So it's beautiful, except for one problem. You may remember
  from your</span> <span m='2967000'>high schools that Mendel also had another law
  about more than one</span> <span m='2973000'>trait, pairs of traits. Not just that
  we have this</span> <span m='2978000'>segregations of alleles away for one trait.
  What was his law about two</span> <span m='2982000'>traits? We'll go over this next
  time. What was his law about two</span> <span m='2986000'>traits, like round and
  wrinkled and green and yellow?</span> </p><p><span m='2990000'>That they would be
  inherited independently of each other.</span> </p><p><span m='2994000'>How would
  that fit into this model? Different chromosomes. They'd be</span> <span m='2998000'>on
  different chromosomes. But what if I had three traits?</span> </p><p><span m='3002000'>Eventually,
  if I had, now, peas actually have seven pairs of</span> <span m='3006000'>chromosomes.
  So if I study eight traits in peas,</span> <span m='3010000'>two would have to lie
  on the same chromosomes. So then the chromosome</span> <span m='3014000'>model would
  contradict independent inheritance. So either Mendel</span> <span m='3019000'>cannot
  be right with this other law of independent inheritance that you</span> <span m='3023000'>learned
  about or the Chromosome Theory cannot be right of these</span> <span m='3027000'>living
  on these physical molecules and getting distributed that way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3032000'>Right? So we have a deep problem because either Mendel,</span> <span
  m='3036000'>my hero, is wrong or this chromosome model is wrong.</span> </p><p><span
  m='3041000'>And the problem is we don't have enough time to resolve this today,</span>
  <span m='3045000'>so we're going to have to come back on Wednesday and figure</span>
