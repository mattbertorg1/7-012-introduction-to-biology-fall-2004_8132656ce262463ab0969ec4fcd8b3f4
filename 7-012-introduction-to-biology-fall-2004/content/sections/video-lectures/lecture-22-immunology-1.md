transcript: '<p><span m=''1000''>Today, we''re talking about immunology as you may
  recall.</span> </p><p><span m=''5000''>Let''s roll. Yes, let''s roll.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''12000''>And by the way, admire your little finger,</span> <span m=''16000''>because
  most of the planet isn''t as gifted as you are.</span> </p><p><span m=''21000''>Not
  everyone was guaranteed so many brains as you and I,</span> <span m=''26000''>seriously,
  have been fortunate enough to have been granted.</span> </p><p><span m=''31000''>Let
  me just finish up what we were talking about last time,</span> <span m=''35000''>which
  was the cell cycle.</span> </p><p><span m=''44000''>You may recall that we talked
  about oncogenes. We talked about Ras and</span> <span m=''48000''>the Ras oncoprotein,
  which sends out mytogenic signals.</span> </p><p><span m=''52000''>And, what it
  does, just to summarize what we were talking about</span> <span m=''56000''>is it
  pushes cells from the beginning of the G1 phase of the</span> <span m=''60000''>cell
  cycle up to a decision point in the life of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m=''65000''>It''s
  called the restriction point. And here, just by way of review,</span> <span m=''69000''>the
  cell has to decide whether or not it''s going to commit itself,</span> <span m=''73000''>essentially
  irreversibly, to go through the rest of the cell cycle,</span> <span m=''77000''>or
  whether it''ll stay in G1, and may even retreat from the cell cycle</span> <span
  m=''82000''>into G0. And Ras pushes this decision forward.</span> </p><p><span m=''86000''>The
  retinoblastoma protein, which we talked about the last time,</span> <span m=''90000''>stands
  as the guardian of the gate right here, the RB protein.</span> </p><p><span m=''95000''>And,
  the retinoblastoma protein holds this gate shut unless and</span> <span m=''98000''>until
  certain preconditions have been satisfied,</span> <span m=''101000''>on which occasion
  the retinoblastoma protein opens up the restriction</span> <span m=''105000''>point
  gate, and allows the cell to go through the rest of the cell</span> <span m=''108000''>cycle.
  And now, interviewed from this perspective,</span> <span m=''112000''>we can begin
  to understand how hyperactivity of Ras,</span> <span m=''115000''>and how the inactivation
  of this RB, this retinoblastoma, tumor</span> <span m=''119000''>suppressor protein
  have such disruptive destabilizing effects on</span> <span m=''122000''>the proliferative
  controls of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m=''126000''>Keep in mind, this is a negative
  actor on cell proliferation.</span> </p><p><span m=''130000''>It''s a tumor suppressor
  gene which must be inactivated in many cancers.</span> </p><p><span m=''134000''>This
  is a proto-oncogene, or an oncogene, which must become</span> <span m=''138000''>hyperactivated.
  Now, I want to move from that into</span> <span m=''142000''>the topic of today,
  and that''s the whole issue of</span> <span m=''146000''>immunity. And, much of
  our immunity comes from</span> <span m=''151000''>understanding the way we deal
  with what viral infections.</span> </p><p><span m=''155000''>The fact is, just to
  cite one arbitrary viral infection,</span> <span m=''159000''>relatively few people
  die from viral infections these days because we can</span> <span m=''164000''>become
  immunized against them. The first immunizations already</span> <span m=''168000''>began
  in the late 18th century, believe it or not, when a physician</span> <span m=''172000''>in
  England called Edward Jenner first noticed that women who had</span> <span m=''177000''>worked
  as milkmaids milking cows, and who got a disease called cowpox</span> <span m=''181000''>from
  milking the cows seemed to be immune to the disease of smallpox</span> <span m=''186000''>which
  was by that time realized to be spreading in epidemic,</span> <span m=''190000''>so
  a highly infectious agent, and one which actually killed quite</span> <span m=''194000''>a
  few people. And Jenner intuited correctly,</span> <span m=''199000''>in retrospect,
  that the experience of these milkmaids and their</span> <span m=''204000''>exposure
  to cowpox exposure somehow protected them,</span> <span m=''209000''>gave them indeed
  lifelong protection from subsequent smallpox infection.</span> </p><p><span m=''215000''>Subsequently
  to that, the sores from the cowpox infection</span> <span m=''219000''>were scraped,
  and the exidate, the fluid, was scratched into wounds</span> <span m=''224000''>of
  people in order to immunize them. And so, immunization them. And so,</span> <span
  m=''229000''>immunization already began in the 1790''s, taking a sore from the skin</span>
  <span m=''234000''>of a cowpox infected patient, injecting that into the skin of</span>
  <span m=''239000''>somebody who required immunization, and as a consequence, hoping
  that</span> <span m=''244000''>this would confer in them lifelong protection.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''249000''>In some cases, actually the individuals who were</span>
  <span m=''253000''>infected in that way actually came down with smallpox or some
  virulent</span> <span m=''257000''>form of this cowpox, but in most other cases
  these</span> <span m=''261000''>individuals actually acquired a lifelong immunity.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''265000''>In fact, the very word vaccine, which was used already
  at the time,</span> <span m=''269000''>comes from the Latin word vaccinus which
  means a cow.</span> </p><p><span m=''273000''>And, in the north side of Cambridge
  Common there''s the Benjamin</span> <span m=''277000''>Waterhouse which is still
  there. He was the first physician to</span> <span m=''282000''>introduce smallpox
  vaccination into this country already in the end of</span> <span m=''287000''>the
  18th century. If we fast forward to a situation</span> <span m=''292000''>like poliovirus,
  we have situations in this country</span> <span m=''297000''>where in the 1930''s-1940''s,
  there were epidemics of poliovirus.</span> </p><p><span m=''302000''>If one began
  to examine who was susceptible and who wasn''t,</span> <span m=''306000''>it was
  clear that children who were, for example, born and raised in</span> <span m=''310000''>middle
  and upper-middle class houses were very susceptible for much of</span> <span m=''314000''>their
  lives. For example, in southern California there were</span> <span m=''318000''>dramatic
  examples, whereas children who grew up across</span> <span m=''322000''>the border
  in, let''s say, Tijuana,</span> <span m=''326000''>Mexico, rarely came down with
  paralytic polio.</span> </p><p><span m=''330000''>Poliovirus, as one soon learned,
  was a virus which infects not only</span> <span m=''334000''>the gastrointestinal
  tract, and creates a form of mild diarrhea,</span> <span m=''338000''>but it may
  be one out of 100 persons the virus escapes from the GI tract,</span> <span m=''343000''>from
  the gastrointestinal tract, invades into the central nervous</span> <span m=''347000''>system,
  and actually creates debilitating paralysis,</span> <span m=''352000''>most of which
  is not healed. And some people have lifelong</span> <span m=''356000''>paralysis.
  Other individuals whose paralytic</span> <span m=''361000''>paralysis goes away,
  actually when they grow older,</span> <span m=''365000''>30, 40, 50 years later,
  they begin once again to experience the</span> <span m=''369000''>paralytic symptoms
  that arose as a consequence of their childhood</span> <span m=''373000''>infection.
  And at this time, one began to try to figure out why</span> <span m=''377000''>children
  living in Tijuana, Mexico rarely came down with</span> <span m=''381000''>poliovirus
  infections, whereas those who grew up up north</span> <span m=''385000''>like, say,
  in southern California did indeed do so.</span> </p><p><span m=''390000''>And one
  came to the conclusion that the children growing up in Tijuana,</span> <span m=''394000''>Mexico
  were frequently exposed very early in their life to contaminated</span> <span m=''398000''>water,
  sewage contaminated water, and they as a consequence acquired a</span> <span m=''402000''>lifelong
  immunity without getting sick, whereas children who grew up</span> <span m=''406000''>in
  rather sterile conditions further north never had any exposure to the</span> <span
  m=''411000''>virus. And when it hit them as young adults or as teenagers,</span>
  <span m=''415000''>it created devastating effects. And this indicates, once again,</span>
  <span m=''419000''>that somehow one''s exposure to an infectious agent,</span> <span
  m=''423000''>historical exposure has a dramatic effect on one''s susceptibility</span>
  <span m=''427000''>to a virus. And in the case of poliovirus,</span> <span m=''432000''>we''re
  dealing here with an agent which is much simpler than the</span> <span m=''436000''>retroviruses
  we talked about last time like RSV.</span> </p><p><span m=''440000''>Poliovirus
  also has a single stranded RNA genome,</span> <span m=''445000''>and that''s encapsidated
  in a proteinaceous coat,</span> <span m=''449000''>which is made up only of viral
  proteins, so it''s very simple single</span> <span m=''453000''>stranded RNA proteinaceous
  coat. The single stranded RNA is actually</span> <span m=''457000''>polyadenylated
  at the three prime end. So, it can serve as a</span> <span m=''460000''>messenger
  RNA. It''s of the same polarity that has</span> <span m=''464000''>a plus polarity,
  which means that it can be</span> <span m=''467000''>translated immediately. I''m
  distinguishing that from the</span> <span m=''470000''>other flavor of single stranded
  RNA which could be of the complementary</span> <span m=''474000''>strand, which
  could exist because one could make double stranded RNA</span> <span m=''477000''>which
  obviously cannot be translated.</span> </p><p><span m=''481000''>So, this can serve
  as a messenger RNA, and just as an aside,</span> <span m=''485000''>the way that
  poliovirus replicates is totally different from that of</span> <span m=''490000''>retroviruses.
  What happens is that poliovirus makes its own polymerase.</span> </p><p><span m=''494000''>You
  go from single stranded RNA to double stranded RNA,</span> <span m=''499000''>i.e.
  the complementary copy is made, and that in turn is used as a</span> <span m=''504000''>template
  for making more single stranded RNA, progeny RNA.</span> </p><p><span m=''509000''>And
  note here that there''s no DNA at all involved. In fact,</span> <span m=''513000''>poliovirus
  can grow inside a cell that has been deprived of its</span> <span m=''517000''>nucleus.
  Moreover, if one stops nuclear DNA dependent</span> <span m=''521000''>transcription,
  that has no effect on this.</span> </p><p><span m=''525000''>But you''ll notice
  correctly that these kind of steps here involved</span> <span m=''529000''>RNA dependent
  RNA polymerases. And in the normal physiology of a</span> <span m=''534000''>cell,
  that such a polymerase, such an enzyme never operates.</span> </p><p><span m=''538000''>And
  therefore, poliovirus must make among its other proteins an RNA</span> <span m=''542000''>dependent
  RNA polymerase that can mediate these steps: making a</span> <span m=''546000''>complementary
  copy of this strand, to get the complementary strand, and</span> <span m=''550000''>then
  making progeny plus strand RNAs.</span> </p><p><span m=''555000''>Again, it has
  a very simple capsid of several viral proteins which wrap</span> <span m=''559000''>it
  up. Now, if one wants to assess the potency of poliovirus RNA,</span> <span m=''564000''>one
  can grow it in a Petri dish. One way of figuring out how much</span> <span m=''568000''>poliovirus
  RNA is in a solution is to make a monolayer of cells like</span> <span m=''573000''>this,
  and then take various dilutions of a virus stalk.</span> </p><p><span m=''578000''>And
  when one talks about a virus stalk, one talks about a solution of</span> <span m=''581000''>virus
  particles. One can''t really see them.</span> </p><p><span m=''584000''>And even
  if one could see them under the electron microscope,</span> <span m=''587000''>one
  wouldn''t really know what fraction of the ones you were seeing</span> <span m=''591000''>were
  actually biologically competent. But most interestingly,</span> <span m=''594000''>you
  can take a solution of poliovirus particles,</span> <span m=''597000''>place it
  on a monolayer of cells here, which can be infected</span> <span m=''601000''>by
  poliovirus. In contrast to what I told you last</span> <span m=''605000''>time about
  RSV, where an infected cell can tolerate</span> <span m=''609000''>the continued
  presence of a viral infection without dying,</span> <span m=''613000''>poliovirus
  is a highly cytopathic virus, and by that I mean it</span> <span m=''617000''>replicates
  inside cells and it kills them during the course of</span> <span m=''621000''>replicating
  inside these cells. So, here what one has is just a</span> <span m=''625000''>poliovirus
  will infect a cell here, and then it will begin to spread</span> <span m=''629000''>from
  that cell to neighboring cells in the surrounds.</span> </p><p><span m=''634000''>And
  in so doing it will create, it will erode a hole right here in</span> <span m=''637000''>the
  monolayer whose presence, a so-called plaque, signifies the</span> <span m=''641000''>fact
  that there was an initially infecting virus particle there that</span> <span m=''645000''>spreads
  centrifugally, that spread outward, from the</span> <span m=''649000''>initially
  infected cell. In detail, if you want to do this</span> <span m=''653000''>experiment
  really nicely, what you do after you infect the</span> <span m=''657000''>initial
  monolayer of cells, which I show here in section,</span> <span m=''661000''>is you
  put on a layer of agarose, or something, above the infected</span> <span m=''665000''>monolayer,
  and that ensures that if there''s any viral spread,</span> <span m=''669000''>it
  will be from cell to cell spread in a certain neighborhood rather</span> <span m=''673000''>than
  virus particles getting into solution and swimming around all</span> <span m=''677000''>over
  the plate and affecting cells helter-skelter.</span> </p><p><span m=''681000''>So
  here, we might want to infect an initial cell right here in the</span> <span m=''684000''>monolayer,
  and now this agarose will confine the subsequent spread of</span> <span m=''688000''>progeny
  virus to adjacent cells in the area, again eroding,</span> <span m=''692000''>ultimately,
  a hole here which we call a plaque.</span> </p><p><span m=''696000''>And if we count
  the number of plaques, that will tell us how many</span> <span m=''700000''>biologically
  active virus particles there were in the initial solution</span> <span m=''705000''>that
  was previously applied to that monolayer culture of the susceptible</span> <span
  m=''709000''>cells. One could use such monolayer cultures, in fact, to propagate</span>
  <span m=''714000''>poliovirus. And one can take the poliovirus</span> <span m=''718000''>coming
  out of those monolayer cultures, and actually use them to</span> <span m=''722000''>inject
  into human beings in order to vaccinate them to confer on them</span> <span m=''726000''>immunity.
  But if you do that with wild type poliovirus,</span> <span m=''729000''>then what
  will happen is that you may inadvertently give that person</span> <span m=''733000''>whom
  you''re attempting to immunize a nasty poliovirus infection which</span> <span m=''737000''>could
  paralyze them, might even kill them.</span> </p><p><span m=''741000''>When I was
  growing up, poliovirus infections were much</span> <span m=''744000''>dreaded because
  we knew of people who were being kept alive in iron</span> <span m=''748000''>lungs
  that breathe for them because their autonomic nervous system had</span> <span m=''752000''>been
  destroyed by a poliovirus infection.</span> </p><p><span m=''756000''>So, what happens
  is therefore if one wishes to immunize somebody,</span> <span m=''760000''>if one
  wishes to vaccinate them against poliovirus,</span> <span m=''765000''>one needs
  to inject them with an attenuated virus,</span> <span m=''769000''>that is, a virus
  whose ability to create disease,</span> <span m=''774000''>whose pathogenic abilities,
  pathogenic, remember, refers to the</span> <span m=''778000''>ability to create
  disease. You want to use an attenuated virus,</span> <span m=''783000''>which might
  be able to go into the body. It might be able to evoke</span> <span m=''787000''>immunity,
  but it will not create a major disease response.</span> </p><p><span m=''792000''>And
  this was dealt with in two different ways.</span> </p><p><span m=''796000''>Jonas
  Salk, one of the pioneers of creating a poliovirus vaccine took</span> <span m=''801000''>the
  poliovirus particles that have been produced by culturing them on</span> <span m=''805000''>monolayers
  of monkey kidney cells, and he treated the poliovirus</span> <span m=''810000''>briefly
  with a little bit of formaldehyde.</span> </p><p><span m=''815000''>And formaldehyde,
  as you may know, reacts with the</span> <span m=''819000''>amine groups of the ribonucleosides,
  of the purines and pyrimidines, and</span> <span m=''823000''>therefore kills the
  virus. And that kill virus, having been</span> <span m=''827000''>treated briefly
  with the formaldehyde, the virus particle is</span> <span m=''831000''>still essentially
  intact, was then injected into individuals.</span> </p><p><span m=''835000''>Alternatively,</span>
  <span m=''840000''>his deadly rival, because they two hated each other''s</span>
  <span m=''844000''>guts, Sabin decided on another strategy for making a vaccine
  stalk.</span> </p><p><span m=''848000''>And that is, he took poliovirus which had
  been passage from one cell</span> <span m=''853000''>culture to the next over extended
  periods of time,</span> <span m=''857000''>over several years. So, it had been passage
  in vitro.</span> </p><p><span m=''862000''>When we say in vitro, in this context
  we mean poliovirus had been</span> <span m=''866000''>taken from one plate, put
  into another plate of cells,</span> <span m=''870000''>taken to another plate of
  cells. In vitro here implies in culture</span> <span m=''875000''>rather than the
  other alternative. In vivo means that the virus is</span> <span m=''879000''>being
  passaged in a living organism. And as it turns out, when you</span> <span m=''883000''>passage
  poliovirus in vitro from passing it just from one culture of</span> <span m=''888000''>cells
  to the next, infecting one after another in a</span> <span m=''892000''>serial or
  sequential fashion, then the virus is selected for its</span> <span m=''896000''>ability
  to proliferate in the cultured cells in vitro.</span> </p><p><span m=''901000''>But
  it gradually loses its ability to create disease in vivo in that</span> <span m=''905000''>there
  is no Darwinian selection to favor its disease causing ability.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''910000''>And consequently, virus that Saben used wasn''t inactivated with</span>
  <span m=''914000''>formaldehyde. It was a simply attenuated because of extensive
  in</span> <span m=''919000''>vitro propagation. And when he injected that into</span>
  <span m=''923000''>young people, very rarely did they ever come down with poliovirus</span>
  <span m=''928000''>infection, and the virus was able to replicate to some extent
  in their</span> <span m=''932000''>bodies without causing disease, and to create
  lifelong immunity.</span> </p><p><span m=''937000''>I.e. such an individual was
  protected from subsequent poliovirus</span> <span m=''941000''>infection ever again.
  And, as it turned out,</span> <span m=''946000''>this was a very nice way of protecting
  because it also turned</span> <span m=''950000''>out the monkey kidney cells that
  were used to propagate the virus</span> <span m=''955000''>also contained certain
  monkey viruses. For example,</span> <span m=''959000''>it came out after years that
  there was a DNA tumor virus.</span> </p><p><span m=''964000''>We''ve been talking
  about RNA tumor viruses until now,</span> <span m=''967000''>but there''s a DNA
  tumor virus called SV40, which is a very potent tumor</span> <span m=''971000''>virus
  in hamsters, and mice, and rats.</span> </p><p><span m=''975000''>And it turns out
  that SV40 lingered. It lurked in monkey kidney cell</span> <span m=''978000''>cultures.
  And, nobody knew about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''982000''>Whenever you put poliovirus
  into many of these cultures,</span> <span m=''986000''>not only did poliovirus replicate,
  but all of a sudden so did SV40.</span> </p><p><span m=''990000''>And therefore,
  many of the stalks of poliovirus</span> <span m=''994000''>that were used to inject
  people like myself, I lived around the corner in</span> <span m=''998000''>Pittsburgh
  from Jonas Salk, and the children in the Pittsburgh</span> <span m=''1002000''>public
  schools were his first guinea pigs. Many of us were exposed to</span> <span m=''1006000''>poliovirus
  stalk which actually had more SV40 particles in it than</span> <span m=''1010000''>poliovirus
  particles because of this inadvertent contamination.</span> </p><p><span m=''1014000''>There
  probably were between 30 and 40 million people who were immunized</span> <span m=''1018000''>with
  poliovirus and inadvertently with SV40 virus.</span> </p><p><span m=''1023000''>And
  one is that epidemiology in the subsequent years to figure out</span> <span m=''1027000''>whether
  that had led to any increased rate of cancer because it</span> <span m=''1031000''>could
  well have. There could have been an epidemic</span> <span m=''1035000''>of cancer
  in this country, millions of people affected because</span> <span m=''1039000''>of
  this unknown, and at the time almost unknowable</span> <span m=''1043000''>contaminating
  virus. As it turns out, people who were</span> <span m=''1047000''>infected with
  SV40 inadvertently have no higher rates of cancer than</span> <span m=''1051000''>anybody
  else even though this virus is a very potently tumorogenic virus</span> <span m=''1055000''>like
  RSV, but doing so in this case in rodent cells and ostensibly</span> <span m=''1059000''>not
  in humans. So, public health measures can</span> <span m=''1063000''>sometimes have
  unforeseen side effects or consequences that nobody</span> <span m=''1067000''>anticipates
  ahead of time. Now, getting back to the whole</span> <span m=''1071000''>strategy
  of poliovirus infection, this raises the issue of what it was</span> <span m=''1076000''>in
  the poliovirus that was able to evoke the subsequent lifelong</span> <span m=''1080000''>immunity.
  And in telling you that, I mentioned the following.</span> </p><p><span m=''1085000''>You
  can make antiserum or you can make serum from an individual who''s</span> <span
  m=''1089000''>been immunized with poliovirus. And, recollect, we mentioned this</span>
  <span m=''1093000''>before, the way to make serum is to allow blood to clot.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1097000''>The red cells and the platelets aggregate in the bottom,</span>
  <span m=''1101000''>and what remains on top is simply serum. You can spin out all
  the</span> <span m=''1105000''>residual cells and so all you get is sort of a straw
  colored fluid.</span> </p><p><span m=''1110000''>And that serum from an individual
  who''s been immunized with poliovirus</span> <span m=''1114000''>stalk can actually
  be used to, you can add it to the poliovirus</span> <span m=''1118000''>stalk prior
  to adding these virus particles to the Petri dish.</span> </p><p><span m=''1122000''>So,
  here''s the Petri dish as before, and what you find is that if you add</span> <span
  m=''1126000''>serum from an individual who''s been immunized to a solution of</span>
  <span m=''1130000''>poliovirus particles, and then you take that mixture and</span>
  <span m=''1134000''>put them on the plate, you no longer get any of these</span>
  <span m=''1138000''>plaques that I referred to before.</span> </p><p><span m=''1143000''>And
  that indicates that within the serum, there is some kind of factor</span> <span
  m=''1147000''>which is neutralizing the infectivity of the polio virus</span> <span
  m=''1152000''>particles, i.e. the poliovirus particles are in some</span> <span
  m=''1156000''>way prevented from creating an infection, and their plaque forming</span>
  <span m=''1161000''>ability, their ability corrode these holes in the monolayers
  of</span> <span m=''1166000''>subsequently infected cultures is now compromised.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1171000''>And such activity suggests that such an individual has
  actually antiserum,</span> <span m=''1175000''>i.e. some kind of reactivity which
  prevents the poliovirus particle</span> <span m=''1179000''>from doing its thing.
  In fact, I can tell you that such</span> <span m=''1184000''>antiserum or such neutralizing
  antiserum can be achieved in a</span> <span m=''1188000''>number of ways. One way
  to do it is just to take</span> <span m=''1193000''>the protein capsid, the outer
  coat of the poliovirus</span> <span m=''1197000''>particle that I described before
  and inject that into an individual.</span> </p><p><span m=''1202000''>And that will
  on its own already evoke a measure of antiviral</span> <span m=''1206000''>immunity.
  It will evoke a concentration of antiserum in the</span> <span m=''1210000''>blood
  of a patient. Or, if you want to do it in a very</span> <span m=''1215000''>much
  more modern way, you can sequence the proteins of the</span> <span m=''1219000''>poliovirus
  and determine the amino acid sequence.</span> </p><p><span m=''1224000''>And when
  you do that, you can synthesize through organic</span> <span m=''1228000''>synthesis
  oligopeptides of 10 or 20 amino acids long.</span> </p><p><span m=''1233000''>And
  these oligopeptides reflect different parts of the poliovirus</span> <span m=''1236000''>coat
  protein. So, if here''s the sequence of one of the</span> <span m=''1239000''>capsid
  proteins, recall that capsid refers to the</span> <span m=''1243000''>coat that''s
  shielding or protecting in this case poliovirus,</span> <span m=''1246000''>the
  single stranded viral RNA genome. So, if here''s one of the capsid</span> <span
  m=''1250000''>proteins, what you can do is to figure out the amino acid sequence</span>
  <span m=''1253000''>of this segment of the capsid protein, and then rather than</span>
  <span m=''1257000''>cutting it out from the capsid protein, you just synthesize
  it by</span> <span m=''1260000''>organic synthesis, ten or twenty amino acid residues</span>
  <span m=''1264000''>long. And when you inject that</span> <span m=''1268000''>oligopeptides
  into an individual, that may also evoke some kind of</span> <span m=''1272000''>neutralizing
  antibody response. In fact, as you might correctly</span> <span m=''1276000''>imagine,
  if we can look in more detail at the capsid structure,</span> <span m=''1281000''>I''m
  just going to draw it in a very primitive way here,</span> <span m=''1285000''>it''s
  obviously much more complicated. But if this is the capsid here,</span> <span m=''1289000''>it
  has an inside and an outside. And the antibodies that you make</span> <span m=''1294000''>against
  an oligopeptide that is sticking out here on the outside</span> <span m=''1299000''>will
  be neutralizing, i.e. the antiserum will be able to</span> <span m=''1303000''>recognize
  the outside of the virus particle and somehow inactivate it.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1308000''>But if you were to use an oligopeptide antigen from over here,</span>
  <span m=''1313000''>which might be a part of the capsid protein that is deep inside,</span>
  <span m=''1317000''>well even though you might have a good reactivity with oligopeptide
  it</span> <span m=''1322000''>would not be neutralizing. And that suggests the notion
  that</span> <span m=''1327000''>whatever is present in the antiserum is recognizing
  some external portion</span> <span m=''1331000''>of this protein which is sticking
  out. And that external portion is</span> <span m=''1336000''>called an antigen.
  So, there''s a specific chemical</span> <span m=''1341000''>structure which is being
  recognized by the antiserum, and we</span> <span m=''1345000''>call that an antigen.
  In principal, there are dozens of</span> <span m=''1350000''>distinct antigens on
  the surface of a poliovirus particle,</span> <span m=''1354000''>each of which one
  can, in principal, make an immunizing antibody against.</span> </p><p><span m=''1359000''>Each
  of those can therefore be considered to be an antigen.</span> </p><p><span m=''1364000''>And,
  how can we imagine this antiserum as actually successfully</span> <span m=''1368000''>neutralizing
  the virus particle? And here, this depended on actually</span> <span m=''1373000''>the
  biochemical characterization of antisera because one soon came to</span> <span m=''1378000''>learn
  that within antisera are what we call antibodies.</span> </p><p><span m=''1383000''>Or,
  keep in mind that in biology you never should ever use a simple</span> <span m=''1387000''>Anglo-Saxon
  word if you can use a much more complicated Greek or Latin</span> <span m=''1391000''>one.
  So, we can always call these immunoglobulins.</span> </p><p><span m=''1396000''>You
  see the word right there. Immunoglobulin represents an</span> <span m=''1400000''>antibody
  molecule, and it turns out that much of the</span> <span m=''1405000''>protein in
  the soluble fraction of our serum consists of such</span> <span m=''1409000''>antibody
  molecules. And these antibody molecules have a</span> <span m=''1414000''>very interesting
  structure which I''d like to dwell upon momentarily.</span> </p><p><span m=''1418000''>But
  before I do that, I''d just want to anticipate what I''m about to say</span> <span
  m=''1422000''>by indicating that we now realize that an antibody molecule can</span>
  <span m=''1426000''>recognize an antigen on the surface of the virus particle,</span>
  <span m=''1430000''>and the antibody molecule can actually physically bind to this</span>
  <span m=''1434000''>antigen. So, we have an antigen antibody complex,</span> <span
  m=''1438000''>and that binding of the antibody molecule to the surface of the virus</span>
  <span m=''1442000''>particle is what results functionally in the neutralization</span>
  <span m=''1446000''>of its infectivity. Or to put it another way,</span> <span m=''1451000''>given
  the fact that this particular capsid protein might be repeated,</span> <span m=''1455000''>let''s
  say, 60 times around a spherical surface of a virus</span> <span m=''1459000''>particle,
  there might be, in fact, 60 different antibody</span> <span m=''1463000''>molecules
  recognizing this repeated antigen which occurs on each of</span> <span m=''1467000''>these
  capsid proteins. And therefore,</span> <span m=''1471000''>you can imagine in a
  very approximate way that if you have an</span> <span m=''1475000''>effective neutralizing
  antibody, it''s coating the surface of the</span> <span m=''1479000''>virus particle
  of antibody molecules, and that clearly obstructs the</span> <span m=''1482000''>ability
  of the virus particle to initiate a subsequent round of</span> <span m=''1486000''>infection.
  Here''s what a single antibody molecule looks like,</span> <span m=''1489000''>and
  it has some critically important features. First of all,</span> <span m=''1493000''>there
  is a specific region of the antibody that recognizes</span> <span m=''1497000''>the
  antigen. In this case, I''m using as the</span> <span m=''1501000''>example the
  antigen an oligopeptide on the surface of the poliovirus</span> <span m=''1505000''>particle.
  And that is located in this part of the antibody molecule.</span> </p><p><span m=''1509000''>Note,
  by the way, the antibody molecule is a heterotetramer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1514000''>It
  has two light chains, two small chains here on the right,</span> <span m=''1518000''>and
  two heavy chains. Note that the cysteine disulphide bonds are</span> <span m=''1523000''>holding
  the entire assembly together. So here, one is not relying on</span> <span m=''1527000''>hydrogen
  bonds to hold together this heterotetramer.</span> </p><p><span m=''1532000''>And
  note the following, that there are portions of the</span> <span m=''1536000''>antibody
  molecule which may be specifically varied from one</span> <span m=''1541000''>antibody
  molecule to another over here, and other portions which are</span> <span m=''1546000''>standard
  operating hardware. And let me elaborate on that for a</span> <span m=''1550000''>moment.
  If you look in the serum of an individual and you try to analyze</span> <span m=''1555000''>the
  chemical structure of the antibody molecules in their serum,</span> <span m=''1560000''>you
  find that for a given type of antibody molecule like this,</span> <span m=''1564000''>all
  the antibody molecules share this constant here: light</span> <span m=''1569000''>purple
  domain. They all have that in common.</span> </p><p><span m=''1573000''>They all
  have in common also the light blue domains.</span> </p><p><span m=''1577000''>But
  if you were able, and we''ll discuss this in a moment</span> <span m=''1581000''>how
  you could do so, if you were able to analyze this</span> <span m=''1585000''>other
  portion, you would find that when you look at</span> <span m=''1589000''>one antibody
  molecule, it has a certain amino acid sequence</span> <span m=''1593000''>here,
  which is involved in antigen recognition, and that this amino</span> <span m=''1597000''>acid
  sequence on the light and heavy chain varies from one heterotetramer</span> <span
  m=''1601000''>to another heterotetramer. And again, I''m going to reinforce</span>
  <span m=''1605000''>that. But I want to indicate that there are, within the human</span>
  <span m=''1610000''>antiserum, millions of structurally distinct antibody molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1615000''>They share in common the structure down here up to this
  point.</span> </p><p><span m=''1620000''>And thereafter, each of them has its own</span>
  <span m=''1623000''>idiosyncratic, its own unusual,</span> <span m=''1626000''>its
  own particular private antigen recognition site,</span> <span m=''1629000''>which
  stems from a region or a pocket of the protein which is</span> <span m=''1633000''>involved
  in antigen recognition and has variable amino acid sequences.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1636000''>Here, you see the way that an x-ray crystallographer would actually</span>
  <span m=''1639000''>visualize this molecule, and you begin to realize that the</span>
  <span m=''1643000''>schematic that I showed you before, in fact, is really doing
  a little</span> <span m=''1646000''>bit of violence to the real amino acid sequence,</span>
  <span m=''1649000''>to the real three dimensional structure, excuse me.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1653000''>Now, note something else that is implicit in what I''ve just said
  but</span> <span m=''1656000''>I haven''t said it explicitly, there are actually
  two antigen</span> <span m=''1660000''>recognition sites, one here and one here.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1664000''>So, this antibody is in that sense bivalent. And if there
  were,</span> <span m=''1668000''>for example, two poliovirus particles, one over
  here and one</span> <span m=''1671000''>over here, you could imagine in principal,
  although I''m not drawing</span> <span m=''1675000''>things to scale, that this
  antibody molecule could</span> <span m=''1679000''>actually use one of its antigen
  recognition sites to bind over here</span> <span m=''1683000''>to one poliovirus
  particle, and this to bind to another</span> <span m=''1687000''>poliovirus particle.
  Now, I''ve told you that the antigen</span> <span m=''1691000''>is recognized by
  this antibody is an oligopeptide, which constitutes a</span> <span m=''1695000''>distinct
  chemical structure. How many different oligopeptides of</span> <span m=''1700000''>ten
  amino acids long are there in the mathematical universe?</span> </p><p><span m=''1705000''>How
  many conceivable ones are there?</span> </p><p><span m=''1710000''>How many amino
  acids are there? 20? So what''s the number? I heard</span> <span m=''1714000''>you
  all say 1020, right? So, that''s an awful lot.</span> </p><p><span m=''1718000''>That''s
  more than you can shake a stick at. So that means that there</span> <span m=''1722000''>are,
  in principal, essentially an infinite number of</span> <span m=''1726000''>oligopeptides
  of ten amino acids long, and each one of those could,</span> <span m=''1730000''>in
  principal constitute a distinct antigen that could be recognized by</span> <span
  m=''1734000''>the antibody molecule. Note that what''s happening here is</span>
  <span m=''1738000''>that a protein antigen such as one of these oligopeptides is
  being</span> <span m=''1742000''>recognized by another protein, which is the antibody
  molecule.</span> </p><p><span m=''1746000''>And therefore, we begin to imagine there''s
  some</span> <span m=''1750000''>kind of lock and key complementarity where somehow
  the amino acid</span> <span m=''1754000''>sequence here recognizes and binds a complementary
  fashion to the antigen</span> <span m=''1758000''>that is being recognized, and
  there''s a physical association</span> <span m=''1762000''>which allows the antibody
  molecule then to attach tightly to the</span> <span m=''1766000''>antigen bearing
  poliovirus particle.</span> </p><p><span m=''1770000''>And, by the way, to put it
  another way,</span> <span m=''1774000''>it could be that some of these poliovirus
  capsid proteins have not</span> <span m=''1779000''>yet been assembled in a virus
  particle. And even if they aren''t,</span> <span m=''1783000''>in principal a free
  protein, a capsid protein of poliovirus,</span> <span m=''1788000''>could also be
  recognized by an antibody molecule and be bound by</span> <span m=''1793000''>the
  antibody molecule. Now, this creates several major</span> <span m=''1797000''>conceptual
  problems. How on earth can the body make</span> <span m=''1802000''>antibody molecules
  that are able to recognize a poliovirus particle?</span> </p><p><span m=''1806000''>Well,
  you''ll say that''s easy. Clearly, in our genes there must be</span> <span m=''1810000''>some
  kind of nucleotide sequence which has up here the ability encode</span> <span m=''1814000''>an
  antigen-binding site. Note, by the way, the</span> <span m=''1819000''>antigen-binding
  site''s actually composed of two different proteins.</span> </p><p><span m=''1823000''>Here''s
  part of the antigen-binding site. Here''s another part of the</span> <span m=''1827000''>antigen-binding
  site. So, it must be on two different</span> <span m=''1831000''>genes. But, these
  two different genes create an antigen-binding site</span> <span m=''1835000''>which
  can recognize poliovirus. Bind the poliovirus antigen and</span> <span m=''1839000''>neutralize
  it. Well, that''s well and good.</span> </p><p><span m=''1843000''>That''s perfectly
  reasonable, but let me tell you what''s</span> <span m=''1847000''>unreasonable
  about that. Each of us during his or her</span> <span m=''1851000''>lifetime are
  going to be infected by literally hundreds of viruses.</span> </p><p><span m=''1855000''>You
  get cold viruses almost every two, three, four, five</span> <span m=''1859000''>times
  a year. By the time you get old,</span> <span m=''1863000''>you actually have acquired
  immunity to many of these,</span> <span m=''1867000''>but during the course of one''s
  lifetime, the immune system has been</span> <span m=''1871000''>able to generate
  antiviral immunity and eliminate virtually all the</span> <span m=''1875000''>viral
  infections you ever got. How many people do you know who</span> <span m=''1879000''>have
  actually died of a viral infection? And yet each one of</span> <span m=''1883000''>these
  viruses is in principal able to replicate throughout your body</span> <span m=''1887000''>and
  kill you, and they never do? So that means that the immune system</span> <span m=''1892000''>is
  extremely effective in developing an antibody or antibodies which</span> <span m=''1896000''>could
  neutralize infecting virus particles. You might have the cold</span> <span m=''1900000''>for
  a day, a week, or two weeks, but eventually the</span> <span m=''1904000''>immune
  system develops enough antibodies and other strategies to</span> <span m=''1908000''>eliminate
  the viral infections from your body. I remember when my</span> <span m=''1912000''>grandfather
  was 94 years old and he got a cold. And he hadn''t had a</span> <span m=''1916000''>cold
  for 20 years because by the age of 75, he had been exposed to almost</span> <span
  m=''1920000''>every virus imaginable. And so, when he got a cold at the</span> <span
  m=''1924000''>age of 94, his brain was still working, he''d forgotten how to blow</span>
  <span m=''1928000''>his nose. It just hadn''t happened to him. He didn''t know what
  it was</span> <span m=''1932000''>like to have a cold anymore. So, it just goes
  to show you that</span> <span m=''1936000''>the immune system can be very versatile
  and very successful.</span> </p><p><span m=''1940000''>But this creates a major
  conceptual problem. How do our genes know how</span> <span m=''1944000''>to create
  antigen-binding sites in our antibodies that recognize all of</span> <span m=''1948000''>the
  infectious viruses that are going to attack us during</span> <span m=''1952000''>a
  lifetime. Do we have a gene for neutralizing</span> <span m=''1956000''>smallpox?
  Do we have a gene for neutralizing poliovirus and</span> <span m=''1960000''>adenovirus,
  which gives us bad head colds. And, rabies virus and</span> <span m=''1964000''>vesicular
  stomatitis virus, and all other kinds of viruses that</span> <span m=''1968000''>we
  are going to experience in a lifetime. Well,</span> <span m=''1972000''>possibly
  we do have a gene for each one of those. But,</span> <span m=''1976000''>then I''m
  beginning to raise some other questions if you believe that,</span> <span m=''1980000''>which
  you shouldn''t. First of all, there are many</span> <span m=''1984000''>different
  distinct oligopeptide antigens on the surface of the</span> <span m=''1988000''>poliovirus
  particle. If you look at the antibodies that</span> <span m=''1992000''>had been
  developed against a poliovirus capsid protein in an</span> <span m=''1996000''>immunized
  individual, they have one antibody that</span> <span m=''1999000''>recognizes one
  part of these capsid protein, and another antibody that</span> <span m=''2003000''>recognized
  another part. So, here''s the surface of the</span> <span m=''2007000''>capsid protein
  blown up now, and we can imagine there are</span> <span m=''2011000''>different
  oligopeptide epitopes on different parts of the protein.</span> </p><p><span m=''2015000''>And
  they''re all ten amino acids long, for example. The fact is,</span> <span m=''2019000''>in
  individuals who have anti-poliovirus antibody,</span> <span m=''2023000''>you can
  find that there''s an antibody that recognizes this</span> <span m=''2028000''>antigen,
  and one that recognizes this antigen, and another that</span> <span m=''2032000''>recognizes
  this antigen. So, the number of distinct antigens</span> <span m=''2037000''>which
  the immune system has succeeded in making antibodies</span> <span m=''2041000''>against,
  vastly exceeds the number of infectious agents we''re going to</span> <span m=''2045000''>experience
  in a lifetime. And, that begins to undermine your</span> <span m=''2050000''>confidence
  in the notion that when we''re born, we already possess the</span> <span m=''2054000''>genes
  to recognize different infectious agents,</span> <span m=''2058000''>and to construct
  neutralizing antibodies against them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2062000''>There''s
  also another flaw in this whole notion that we inherit a set</span> <span m=''2066000''>of
  genes that enable us from the get-go to make specific</span> <span m=''2070000''>antibodies.
  And that flaw comes from the</span> <span m=''2074000''>following notion. Evolution
  cannot anticipate which</span> <span m=''2078000''>infectious agents each one of
  us is going to experience in a lifetime.</span> </p><p><span m=''2082000''>Let''s
  say that some of us experience a totally new kind of a</span> <span m=''2087000''>viral
  infection which had never been experienced by our ancestors.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2091000''>If the way of neutralizing that virus, and defending us against that</span>
  <span m=''2095000''>infection depended on using an antibody molecule whose sequence
  was</span> <span m=''2100000''>encoded in our germ line in the genes we inherited
  at birth,</span> <span m=''2104000''>then we might be in bad shape if that virus
  was a novel virus to</span> <span m=''2108000''>which the human race had never been
  exposed.</span> </p><p><span m=''2113000''>And in arguing that, I''m telling you
  that it''s impossible</span> <span m=''2117000''>to imagine a situation where our
  germ line, the set of genes we are</span> <span m=''2121000''>born with that we
  start life with, already contains the information for</span> <span m=''2126000''>making
  each one of the different kinds of antibodies that</span> <span m=''2130000''>are
  in our antiserum. How many different kinds of</span> <span m=''2134000''>antibodies
  are in our antiserum? Well now, the whole notion becomes</span> <span m=''2138000''>even
  more stark because there''s probably millions,</span> <span m=''2142000''>maybe
  even ten or 100 million distinct antibody molecules floating</span> <span m=''2146000''>around
  in our blood. Each one in this case has the same</span> <span m=''2150000''>constant
  region down here. You see the constant region,</span> <span m=''2154000''>and each
  one of these 100 million distinct antibody species has its</span> <span m=''2158000''>own
  antigen-combining site. Now, if we want to pursue that</span> <span m=''2161000''>further,
  we have to begin to imagine how the immune system can make so</span> <span m=''2165000''>many
  different antibody molecules. This itself is a major conceptual</span> <span m=''2169000''>challenge.
  And now we have to go and know a little bit of cell</span> <span m=''2173000''>biology
  because if we look at the immune system,</span> <span m=''2176000''>and there are
  cells forming in the immune system,</span> <span m=''2180000''>we find a set of
  cells that are called B cells or a subset of B</span> <span m=''2184000''>cells
  that are called plasma cells. And the plasma cells, and there''s a</span> <span
  m=''2188000''>whole bunch of different plasma cells.</span> </p><p><span m=''2192000''>So
  the plasma cells are floating around in the circulation,</span> <span m=''2195000''>and
  the plasma cells are able to secrete antibody molecules into the</span> <span m=''2199000''>serum.
  And they are abundant. They''re around by the billions</span> <span m=''2203000''>inside
  our body. And these plasma cells are</span> <span m=''2207000''>constantly secreting
  antibody molecules into the serum around them</span> <span m=''2211000''>into the
  plasma around them. And these are the antibody</span> <span m=''2215000''>molecules
  I''ve been talking about here, the antibody molecules that</span> <span m=''2219000''>are
  capable of neutralizing poliovirus particles.</span> </p><p><span m=''2223000''>So,
  this now creates another conceptual question.</span> </p><p><span m=''2226000''>Let''s
  imagine for the sake of argument that in our blood stream</span> <span m=''2230000''>there
  are 100 million distinct antigen species floating around.</span> </p><p><span m=''2233000''>And
  I don''t mean 100 million molecules. I mean there''s a million</span> <span m=''2237000''>molecules,
  and each one of these species has a different</span> <span m=''2241000''>antigen-binding
  site. So, there may be many</span> <span m=''2244000''>antigen-binding sites. There
  may be many antibody</span> <span m=''2248000''>molecules. There may be million
  of this kind of</span> <span m=''2252000''>antibody that recognize this antigen.
  There may be millions of this</span> <span m=''2256000''>antibody recognizing this
  antigen, millions of this antibody</span> <span m=''2260000''>recognizing this antigen
  on the surface of poliovirus.</span> </p><p><span m=''2264000''>And I''m saying
  there could be a million distinct species of</span> <span m=''2268000''>antibodies,
  each species being defined by the antigen that</span> <span m=''2272000''>recognizes
  and by the structure of its antigen-recognizing site,</span> <span m=''2276000''>its
  antigen-binding site. In other words,</span> <span m=''2280000''>to repeat myself,
  what distinguishes one species of</span> <span m=''2283000''>antibodies from another
  is the amino acid sequence,</span> <span m=''2286000''>the structure of this particular
  region of the antibody molecule that</span> <span m=''2289000''>makes one species
  of antibody different from the other.</span> </p><p><span m=''2292000''>And with
  all that in mind, we have two alternative scenarios.</span> </p><p><span m=''2296000''>Let''s
  again say there''s a million different species of antibodies</span> <span m=''2299000''>being
  secreted into the antiserum at any one point in time.</span> </p><p><span m=''2302000''>This
  cell could make all million. This cell could make the whole</span> <span m=''2305000''>million
  species. This cell could,</span> <span m=''2308000''>and this cell could. In other
  words,</span> <span m=''2312000''>each one of these B cells could be multitalented,</span>
  <span m=''2318000''>able to simultaneously make a million different kinds of antibody</span>
  <span m=''2323000''>molecules. The opposite model is as follows, and that is that
  this B</span> <span m=''2329000''>cell makes one species of antibody. We''ll call
  it antibody A, and this</span> <span m=''2334000''>species makes another species
  of antibody molecule.</span> </p><p><span m=''2340000''>So, this B cell makes antibody
  A. This B cell makes antibody B. This</span> <span m=''2344000''>B cell makes antibody
  C. And keep in mind that when I''m</span> <span m=''2348000''>saying antibody A,
  B, and C, I mean A has a certain</span> <span m=''2352000''>antigen-binding site.
  Be has another antigen binding site.</span> </p><p><span m=''2357000''>C has yet
  another antigen binding site. And, we can distinguish</span> <span m=''2361000''>between
  these two alternative mechanistic models by looking at the</span> <span m=''2365000''>disease
  called multiple myeloma. And what you have in multiple</span> <span m=''2369000''>myeloma
  is the following. All of a sudden,</span> <span m=''2373000''>the blood stream becomes
  full of much greatly elevated levels of</span> <span m=''2377000''>antibody molecules.
  They''re present in the blood stream.</span> </p><p><span m=''2381000''>Now, normally,
  if you look at all the antibody</span> <span m=''2385000''>molecules in the blood
  stream and you were to separate them by some</span> <span m=''2388000''>kind of
  electrophoretic technique which distinguished them on the</span> <span m=''2392000''>basis
  of subtle differences in the amino acid sequence,</span> <span m=''2396000''>and
  let''s not worry about exactly how you do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2400000''>But
  we''ve talked about a million different antibody species.</span> </p><p><span m=''2403000''>They''re
  chemically slightly different from one another by virtue</span> <span m=''2407000''>of
  the antigen-recognizing site. And if you could separate them by</span> <span m=''2411000''>some
  kind of system that separated them on the basis of their charge,</span> <span m=''2415000''>you''d
  find a whole spectrum of different antibody molecules,</span> <span m=''2418000''>a
  million in this large, heterogeneous mixture of antibody</span> <span m=''2422000''>molecules,
  each species found somewhere or another in this very</span> <span m=''2426000''>broad
  distribution of 100 million distinct species which are all mixed</span> <span m=''2430000''>together
  in the antiserum. If you look at the serum or the</span> <span m=''2433000''>plasma
  of a patient suffering from multiple myeloma,</span> <span m=''2437000''>what you
  find is the following, that one species of antibody</span> <span m=''2441000''>molecules
  dominates over all the other ones. And so now,</span> <span m=''2445000''>whereas
  that single species might only be on average one millionth of</span> <span m=''2449000''>the
  total antibody complement in the blood. In those suffering from</span> <span m=''2453000''>myeloma,
  or sometimes it''s called multiple myeloma,</span> <span m=''2457000''>now one single
  antibody species may represent 60, 70,</span> <span m=''2461000''>or 80% of all
  the antibody molecules in the blood.</span> </p><p><span m=''2465000''>And clearly
  something has gone very wrong. And if you look at what</span> <span m=''2469000''>happened
  in the case of an individual of multiple myeloma,</span> <span m=''2474000''>if
  we look at that diagram up there, what you see now is that instead of</span> <span
  m=''2478000''>there being many different B cells that are equivalently represented
  in</span> <span m=''2483000''>the blood stream, now one of the B cell types has</span>
  <span m=''2488000''>begun to multiple uncontrollably, and this vasicular B cell
  type,</span> <span m=''2492000''>which I indicate up there, which happens to be
  specifically</span> <span m=''2497000''>able to make antibody C in this model, now
  this particular species</span> <span m=''2502000''>of B cells is now a predominant
  constituent of the population of B</span> <span m=''2506000''>cells in the blood.
  So just to reiterate,</span> <span m=''2510000''>in the normal blood, there are
  a million different sub-populations of</span> <span m=''2514000''>B cells. But in
  these individuals, one of the sub-populations of B</span> <span m=''2518000''>cells
  has expanded. It''s created a monoclonal growth.</span> </p><p><span m=''2521000''>Keep
  in mind monoclonal refers to the fact that all the cells in this</span> <span m=''2525000''>tumor,
  and there is a tumor, descend from the same ancestor.</span> </p><p><span m=''2529000''>So,
  it''s a monoclonal growth. It''s a kind of cancer.</span> </p><p><span m=''2533000''>It''s
  a kind of blood cancer. And all the cells in this</span> <span m=''2537000''>population
  make the identical antibody molecule,</span> <span m=''2541000''>which explains
  this very homogeneous peak here riding above the very</span> <span m=''2545000''>heterogeneous
  mixture of antibodies, the background heterogeneity that</span> <span m=''2549000''>normally
  characterizes normal serum.</span> </p><p><span m=''2553000''>And what that clearly
  indicates is that each different B cell or plasma</span> <span m=''2556000''>cell
  as you will like to call it in our normal serum is specialized to</span> <span m=''2560000''>make
  its own particular kind of antibody. It''s not that a single B</span> <span m=''2564000''>cell
  can make a million different antibodies. Each B cell makes a</span> <span m=''2568000''>very
  specific kind of antibody. And when I say a specific antibody</span> <span m=''2572000''>or
  a specific antibody species, again I''m referring to an antibody</span> <span m=''2576000''>that
  has a specific antigen-binding site.</span> </p><p><span m=''2580000''>Or to put
  it another way, all of the antibody molecules coming</span> <span m=''2584000''>out
  of a single B cell are identical with one another.</span> </p><p><span m=''2589000''>That,
  then, raises the question of how the B cell learns how to make</span> <span m=''2594000''>that
  antibody molecule and not other antibody molecules.</span> </p><p><span m=''2599000''>There''s
  yet another puzzle we have to answer, and that''s the following.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2603000''>If you look at the serum response of an individual to a viral</span>
  <span m=''2608000''>infection, it looks like this. And here, let''s look at what''s</span>
  <span m=''2612000''>present in the ordinate, and it''s on a log scale as you can</span>
  <span m=''2616000''>see here, and what''s present on the abscissa. If one is initially</span>
  <span m=''2620000''>exposed to an antigen and develops an immunity, then here is
  the wave</span> <span m=''2624000''>of antibody production and the concentration
  of antibody against,</span> <span m=''2628000''>let''s say, poliovirus that is present
  in the blood of a recently</span> <span m=''2632000''>infected individual. They''re
  exposed to the antigen,</span> <span m=''2636000''>or in this case the poliovirus
  capsid protein.</span> </p><p><span m=''2640000''>In the days and weeks that follow,
  they develop a significant level of</span> <span m=''2644000''>antibody which is
  used to neutralize, in this case the infected poliovirus</span> <span m=''2649000''>particles.
  And then once the poliovirus is cleared from the</span> <span m=''2653000''>system,
  i.e. once all the infectious particles have been neutralized,</span> <span m=''2658000''>then
  the antibody molecules go down almost to zero,</span> <span m=''2663000''>and there''s
  virtually no antibody against poliovirus left around.</span> </p><p><span m=''2668000''>But
  look what happens when that individual is re-exposed to</span> <span m=''2672000''>poliovirus
  years later. All of a sudden, now he or she</span> <span m=''2677000''>mounts a
  massive antibody response vastly higher than the initial one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2681000''>Well, you say it''s only twofold higher than this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2686000''>But let''s look at the ordinate. This is a logarithmic plot. So,</span>
  <span m=''2690000''>on this plot, the secondary antibody response is maybe 100 or
  200 times</span> <span m=''2695000''>more vigorous, much higher antibody production.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2700000''>Let''s think about this time years later when that person
  is exposed to</span> <span m=''2704000''>a second virus. Let''s say that person
  is exposed</span> <span m=''2708000''>subsequently to cold virus, adenovirus. Does
  the exposure to</span> <span m=''2713000''>poliovirus here in the blue curve help
  that person develop an</span> <span m=''2717000''>adenovirus antibody response?
  The answer is absolutely not.</span> </p><p><span m=''2721000''>There''s no cross-immunity.
  And so, when that individual years later</span> <span m=''2726000''>becomes exposed
  to adenovirus, there''s once again the same kind of</span> <span m=''2730000''>initial
  response that happened as a consequence of previously being</span> <span m=''2734000''>exposed
  to poliovirus. It''s a rather weak response.</span> </p><p><span m=''2739000''>It''s
  effective enough in developing the initial virus eliminating</span> <span m=''2743000''>ability,
  but it''s not very strong. What is this telling us? I''m glad</span> <span m=''2747000''>I
  asked that question. It''s telling us that that immune</span> <span m=''2751000''>system
  is able to remember over a period of months,</span> <span m=''2755000''>years, and
  decades that a previous exposure to this antigen has</span> <span m=''2759000''>occurred
  because here the immune system in this second red curve</span> <span m=''2763000''>knows,
  somehow remembers, that there was an exposure years</span> <span m=''2767000''>earlier.
  And not only does it remember and</span> <span m=''2772000''>respond rapidly, but
  it responds much more vigorously.</span> </p><p><span m=''2776000''>And here now,
  we begin to recognize some of the</span> <span m=''2780000''>outlines of immunity
  because the immune system remembers this earlier</span> <span m=''2784000''>exposure,
  and when it''s provoked a second time, through an accidental</span> <span m=''2788000''>and
  inadvertent exposure to poliovirus on a second occasion,</span> <span m=''2792000''>now
  it really goes to town. And now it creates antisera which is</span> <span m=''2796000''>much
  more vigorous than it was during the first exposure.</span> </p><p><span m=''2800000''>If
  the first exposure had never occurred, there wouldn''t be such a</span> <span m=''2804000''>vigorous
  response. Look at this one over here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2807000''>So now,
  we begin to realize two mysteries that we have to explain</span> <span m=''2811000''>next
  time in our further discussion of the immune system.</span> </p><p><span m=''2815000''>First
  of all, how do B cells figure out how to make so many different</span> <span m=''2819000''>kinds
  of antibody molecules. And secondly, how does the immune</span> <span m=''2823000''>system
  remember from one decade to the next, that exposure to a</span> <span m=''2827000''>previous
  antigen has occurred which merits a vigorous response.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832000''>See
  you then on Friday.</span> </p>'
