transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>As I'm going to argue repeatedly today, biology has\
  \ become a science</span> <span m='4000'>over the last 50 years. And, as a consequence,\
  \ we can talk</span> <span m='8000'>about some basic principles. We can talk about\
  \ some laws and</span> <span m='12000'>then begin to apply them to very interesting\
  \ biological problems.</span> </p><p><span m='16000'>And so our general strategy\
  \ this semester, as it has been in the past,</span> <span m='20000'>is to spend\
  \ roughly the first half of the semester talking about the</span> <span m='24000'>basic\
  \ laws and rules that govern all forms of biological life</span> <span m='28000'>on\
  \ this planet. And you can see some of the specific</span> <span m='34000'>kinds\
  \ of problems, including the problem of cancer,</span> <span m='40000'>how cancer\
  \ cells begin to grow abnormally, how viruses proliferate,</span> <span m='46000'>how\
  \ the immune system functions, how the nervous system functions,</span> <span m='52000'>stem\
  \ cells and how they work and their impact on modern biology,</span> <span m='58000'>molecular\
  \ medicine, and finally perhaps the future of biology and</span> <span m='64000'>even\
  \ certain aspects of evolution. The fact of the matter is that we</span> <span m='69000'>now\
  \ understand lots of these things in ways that were inconceivable 50</span> <span\
  \ m='73000'>years ago. And now we could begin to talk about things that 50 years</span>\
  \ <span m='78000'>ago people could not have dreamt of. When I took this course,\
  \ and I did</span> <span m='82000'>take it in 1961, we didn't know about 80% of\
  \ what we</span> <span m='86000'>now know. You cannot say that about mechanics</span>\
  \ <span m='91000'>in physics, you cannot say that about circuit theory in electronics,</span>\
  \ <span m='95000'>and you cannot say that, obviously, about chemistry.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='100000'>And I'm mentioning that to you simply because this field has</span>\
  \ <span m='104000'>changed enormously over the ensuing four decades. I won't tell\
  \ you what</span> <span m='108000'>grade I got in 7. 1 because if I would,</span>\
  \ <span m='113000'>and you might pry it out of me later in the semester,</span>\
  \ <span m='117000'>you probably would never show up again in lecture.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='122000'>But in any case, please know that this has been an</span> <span m='126000'>area\
  \ of enormous ferment. And the reason it's been in such</span> <span m='131000'>enormous\
  \ ferment is of the discovery in 1953 by Watson and Crick of the</span> <span m='136000'>structure\
  \ of the DNA double helix. Last year I said that we were so</span> <span m='141000'>close\
  \ to this discovery that both Watson and Crick are alive and with</span> <span m='145000'>us\
  \ and metabolically active, and more than 50 years, well,</span> <span m='150000'>exactly\
  \ 50 years after the discovery. Sadly, several months ago one of the</span> <span\
  \ m='155000'>two characters, Francis Crick died well into his</span> <span m='159000'>eighties,\
  \ and so he is no longer with us. But I want to impress on</span> <span m='163000'>you\
  \ the notion that 200 years from now, we will talk about Watson and</span> <span\
  \ m='167000'>Crick the same way that people talk about Isaac Newton in terms of</span>\
  \ <span m='171000'>physics. And that will be so because we are only beginning to</span>\
  \ <span m='175000'>perceive the ramifications of this enormous revolution that was</span>\
  \ <span m='179000'>triggered by their discovery. That is the field of molecular</span>\
  \ <span m='182000'>biology and genetics and biochemistry which has totally</span>\
  \ <span m='186000'>changed our perceptions of how life on Earth is actually organized.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='190000'>Much of the biology to which you may have been exposed\
  \ until now has</span> <span m='194000'>been a highly descriptive science. That\
  \ is you may have had courses in</span> <span m='197000'>high school where you had\
  \ to memorize the names of different</span> <span m='201000'>organisms, where you\
  \ had to understand how evolutionary</span> <span m='205000'>phylogenies were organized,\
  \ where you had to learn the names of</span> <span m='209000'>different organelles,\
  \ and that biology was, for you,</span> <span m='213000'>a field of memorization.\
  \ And one point we would like,</span> <span m='217000'>hopefully successfully, to\
  \ drive home this semester is the notion</span> <span m='221000'>that biology has\
  \ now achieved a logical and rational coherence that</span> <span m='226000'>allows\
  \ us to articulate a whole set of rules that explain how all life</span> <span m='230000'>forms\
  \ on this planet are organized. It's no longer just a collection of</span> <span\
  \ m='234000'>jumbled facts. Indeed, if one masters these</span> <span m='239000'>molecular\
  \ and genetic principles, one can understand in principle a</span> <span m='244000'>large\
  \ number of processes that exist in the biosphere and begin to apply</span> <span\
  \ m='249000'>one's molecular biology to solving new problems in this arena.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='254000'>One of the important ideas that we'll refer to repeatedly\
  \ this</span> <span m='259000'>semester is the fact that many of the biological\
  \ attributes that we</span> <span m='264000'>posses now were already developed a\
  \ very long time ago early in the</span> <span m='269000'>inception of life on this\
  \ planet. So if we look at the history of</span> <span m='274000'>Earth, here the\
  \ history of Earth is given as 5 billion years,</span> <span m='278000'>this is\
  \ in thousands obviously. The Earth is probably not that old.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='282000'>It's probably 4.5 or 4 or 3 billion years but, anyhow,</span> <span\
  \ m='287000'>that's when the planet first aggregated, as far as we know.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='291000'>One believes that no life existed for perhaps the first\
  \ half billion</span> <span m='296000'>years, but after half a billion years, which\
  \ is a lot of time to be</span> <span m='300000'>sure, there already begins to be\
  \ traces of life forms on the surface</span> <span m='304000'>of this planet. And\
  \ that, itself,</span> <span m='308000'>is an extraordinary testimonial, a testimonial\
  \ to how evolutionary</span> <span m='311000'>processes occur. We don't know how\
  \ many planets</span> <span m='315000'>there are in the universe where similar things\
  \ happened.</span> </p><p><span m='318000'>And we don't know whether the solution\
  \ that were arrived at by</span> <span m='321000'>other life systems in other places\
  \ in the universe,</span> <span m='325000'>which we may or may not ever discover,\
  \ were the similar solutions</span> <span m='328000'>to the ones that have been\
  \ arrived at here.</span> </p><p><span m='332000'>It's clear, for example, that\
  \ to the extent that Darwinian</span> <span m='335000'>Evolution governs the development\
  \ of life forms on this planet that is</span> <span m='339000'>not an artifact of\
  \ the Earth. Darwinian Evolution is a logic</span> <span m='342000'>which is applicable\
  \ to all life forms and all biosystems that may</span> <span m='346000'>exist in\
  \ the universe, even the ones we have not discovered.</span> </p><p><span m='349000'>However,\
  \ there are specific solutions that were arrived at</span> <span m='353000'>during\
  \ the development of life on Earth which may be peculiar to Earth.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='356000'>The structure of the DNA double helix.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>The\
  \ use of ribose in deoxyribose. The choice of amino acids to make</span> <span m='364000'>proteins.\
  \ And those specific solutions may not be universal.</span> </p><p><span m='368000'>Whether\
  \ they're universal in the sense of existing in all life forms</span> <span m='372000'>across\
  \ the planet, the fact is that many of the</span> <span m='376000'>biochemical and\
  \ molecular solutions that are represented in our own</span> <span m='380000'>cells\
  \ today, these solutions, these problems were solved already 2</span> <span m='384000'>and\
  \ 3 billion years ago. And once they were solved they were</span> <span m='389000'>kept\
  \ and conserved almost unchanged for the intervening 2 or 3 billion</span> <span\
  \ m='394000'>years. And that strong degree of conservation means that we can begin</span>\
  \ <span m='398000'>to figure out what these principles were early on in evolution\
  \ of life</span> <span m='403000'>on this planet and begin to apply them to all\
  \ modern life forms.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>From the point of view of evolution,\
  \ almost all animals are identical in</span> <span m='413000'>terms of their biochemistry\
  \ and in terms of their physiology.</span> </p><p><span m='418000'>The molecular\
  \ biology of all eukaryotic cells,</span> <span m='421000'>that is all cells that\
  \ have nuclei in them, is almost the same.</span> </p><p><span m='425000'>And, therefore,\
  \ we're not going to focus much in this course this</span> <span m='429000'>semester\
  \ on specific species but rather focus on general principles</span> <span m='432000'>that\
  \ would allow us to understand the cells and the tissues and the</span> <span m='436000'>physiological\
  \ processes that are applicable to all species on the</span> <span m='440000'>surface\
  \ of the planet. Let's just look here and get us</span> <span m='443000'>some perspective\
  \ on this because, the fact of the matter is, is that</span> <span m='447000'>multicellular\
  \ life forms, like ourselves, we have, the average</span> <span m='451000'>human\
  \ being has roughly three or four or five times ten to the</span> <span m='455000'>thirteenth\
  \ cells in the body. That's an interesting figure.</span> </p><p><span m='459000'>The\
  \ average human being goes through roughly ten to the sixteenth</span> <span m='463000'>cell\
  \ divisions in a lifetime, i.e. ten to the sixteenth times in</span> <span m='467000'>your\
  \ body there will be cells that divide, grow and divide.</span> </p><p><span m='471000'>Every\
  \ day in your body there are roughly ten to the eleventh cells</span> <span m='475000'>that\
  \ grow and divide. Think of that, ten to the eleventh.</span> </p><p><span m='479000'>And\
  \ you can divide that by the number of minutes in a day and come</span> <span m='483000'>up\
  \ with an astounding degree of cellular replication going on.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='487000'>All of these processes can be traceable back to solutions that</span>\
  \ <span m='491000'>were arrived at very early in the evolution of life on this planet,</span>\
  \ <span m='496000'>perhaps 550, 600 million years ago when the first multicellular\
  \ life</span> <span m='501000'>forms began to evolve. Before that time, that is\
  \ to say</span> <span m='506000'>before 500 to 600 million years ago, there were\
  \ single-cell organisms.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>For example, many of them\
  \ survive to this day. There were yeast-like</span> <span m='516000'>organisms.\
  \ And there were bacteria. And we make one large and major</span> <span m='521000'>distinction\
  \ between the two major life forms on the planet in terms of</span> <span m='527000'>cells.\
  \ One are the prokaryotic cells. And these are the cells of</span> <span m='532000'>bacteria,\
  \ I'll show you an image of them shortly, which lack nuclei.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='538000'>And the eukaryotic cells which poses nuclei and indeed have a highly</span>\
  \ <span m='542000'>complex cytoplasm and overall cellular architecture.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='546000'>We think that the prokaryotic life forms on this planet evolved first</span>\
  \ <span m='550000'>probably on the order of 3 billion years ago, maybe 3.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='555000'>billion years ago, and that about 1. billion years ago\
  \ cells evolved</span> <span m='559000'>that contained nuclei. Again, I'll show\
  \ them to you</span> <span m='563000'>shortly. And these nucleated cells,</span>\
  \ <span m='568000'>the eukaryotes then existed in single-cell form for perhaps the</span>\
  \ <span m='572000'>next 700 or 800 million years until multi-cellular aggregates\
  \ of</span> <span m='577000'>eukaryotic cells first assembled to become the ancestors\
  \ of the</span> <span m='581000'>multi-cellular plants and the multi-cellular animals\
  \ that exist on</span> <span m='585000'>the surface of the Earth today. To put that\
  \ in perspective, our</span> <span m='590000'>species has only been on the planet\
  \ for about 150,</span> <span m='594000'>00 years. So we've all been here for that\
  \ period of time.</span> </p><p><span m='599000'>And a 150,000 sounds like a long\
  \ time, in one sense,</span> <span m='603000'>but it's just \x93a blink in the eye\
  \ of the Lord\x94 as one says in terms of</span> <span m='608000'>the history of\
  \ life on this planet, and obviously the history of the</span> <span m='612000'>universe\
  \ which is somewhere between 13 and 15 billion years old.</span> </p><p><span m='617000'>You\
  \ can begin to see that the appearance of humans represents a</span> <span m='622000'>very\
  \ small segment of the entire history of life on this planet.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='627000'>And here you can roughly see the way that life has developed during\
  \ this</span> <span m='632000'>period of time from the fossil record. You see that\
  \ many plants</span> <span m='637000'>actually go back a reasonable length of time,\
  \ but not more than maybe 300</span> <span m='642000'>or 400 million years. Here\
  \ are the Metazoa.</span> </p><p><span m='647000'>And this represents --</span>\
  \ <span m='660000'>Well, can you hear me? Wow, 614 came in handy.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='667000'>OK. So if we talk about another major division,</span> <span m='675000'>we\
  \ talk about protozoa and metazoa. The suffix zoa refers to animals,</span> <span\
  \ m='682000'>as in a zoo. And the protozoa represents single-cell organisms.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='690000'>The metazoa represent multi-cellular organisms. And we're\
  \ going to be</span> <span m='694000'>focusing largely on the biology of metazoan\
  \ cells this semester,</span> <span m='698000'>and we're going to be spending almost\
  \ no time on plants.</span> </p><p><span m='703000'>It's not that plants aren't\
  \ important. It's just that we don't</span> <span m='707000'>have time to cover\
  \ everything. And, indeed, the molecular biology</span> <span m='712000'>that you\
  \ learn this semester will ultimately enable you to understand</span> <span m='716000'>much\
  \ about the physiology of multi-cellular plants which happen</span> <span m='721000'>to\
  \ be called metaphyta, a term you may never hear again in</span> <span m='725000'>your\
  \ entire life after today. That reminds me,</span> <span m='730000'>by the way,\
  \ that both Dr. Lander and I sometimes use big words.</span> </p><p><span m='734000'>And\
  \ people come up to me afterwards each semester each year and say</span> <span m='738000'>Professor\
  \ Weinberg, why don't you talk simple,</span> <span m='742000'>why don't you talk\
  \ the way we heard things in high school?</span> </p><p><span m='746000'>And please\
  \ understand that if I use big words sometimes it's to broaden</span> <span m='750000'>your\
  \ vocabulary so you can learn big words.</span> </p><p><span m='754000'>One of the\
  \ things you should be able, one of the big take-home lessons of</span> <span m='757000'>this\
  \ course should be that your vocabulary is expanded.</span> </p><p><span m='761000'>Not\
  \ just your scientific vocabulary but your general working English</span> <span\
  \ m='764000'>vocabulary. Perhaps the biggest goal of this course,</span> <span m='768000'>by\
  \ the way, is not that you learn the names of all the organelles and</span> <span\
  \ m='771000'>cells but that you learn how to think in a scientific and rational</span>\
  \ <span m='775000'>way. Not just because of this course but that this course</span>\
  \ <span m='779000'>helps you to do so. And as such, we don't place that</span> <span\
  \ m='782000'>much emphasis on memorization but to be able to think logically about</span>\
  \ <span m='786000'>scientific problems. Here we can begin to see the</span> <span\
  \ m='790000'>different kinds of metazoa, the animals. Here are the metaphyta</span>\
  \ <span m='794000'>and here are the protozoa, different words for all of these.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='797000'>And here we see our own phylum, the chordates. And,</span>\
  \ <span m='801000'>again, keep in mind that this line right down here is about 550\
  \ to 600</span> <span m='805000'>million years ago, just to give you a time scale\
  \ for</span> <span m='809000'>what's been going on, on this planet.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='813000'>One point we'll return to repeatedly throughout the semester is that\
  \ all</span> <span m='817000'>life forms on this planet are related to one another.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='821000'>It's not as if life was invented multiple times on this\
  \ planet and</span> <span m='825000'>that there are multiple independent inventions\
  \ to the extent that life</span> <span m='830000'>arose more than once on this planet,\
  \ and it may have. The other</span> <span m='834000'>alternative or competing life\
  \ forms were soon wiped out by our ancestors,</span> <span m='838000'>our single-cellular\
  \ ancestors 3 billion years ago.</span> </p><p><span m='843000'>And, therefore,\
  \ everything that exists today on this</span> <span m='847000'>planet represents\
  \ the descendents of that successful group of cells that</span> <span m='851000'>existed\
  \ a very long time ago. Here we have all this family tree</span> <span m='855000'>of\
  \ the different metazoan forms that have been created by the florid hand</span>\
  \ <span m='860000'>of evolution. And we're not going to study those phylogenies\
  \ simply</span> <span m='864000'>because we want to understand principles that explain\
  \ all of them.</span> </p><p><span m='869000'>Not just how this or that particular\
  \ organism is able to digest its food</span> <span m='872000'>or is able to reproduce.\
  \ Here's another thing we're not</span> <span m='875000'>going to talk about. We're\
  \ not going to talk about</span> <span m='878000'>complicated life forms. We're\
  \ not going to talk very much,</span> <span m='882000'>in fact hardly at all, about\
  \ ecology. This is just one such thing,</span> <span m='885000'>the way that a parasite\
  \ is able to, a tapeworm is able to infect people.</span> </p><p><span m='888000'>This\
  \ is, again, I'm showing you this not to say this is what we're</span> <span m='892000'>going\
  \ to talk about, we're not going to talk about that.</span> </p><p><span m='895000'>We're\
  \ not going to talk about that. There's a wealth of detail that's</span> <span m='899000'>known\
  \ about the way life exists in the biosphere that we're simply</span> <span m='903000'>going\
  \ to turn our backs on by focusing on some basic principles.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='907000'>We're also not going to talk about anatomy. Here in quick order are</span>\
  \ <span m='912000'>some of the anatomies you may have learned about in high school,</span>\
  \ <span m='916000'>and I'm giving them to you each with a three-second minute,</span>\
  \ <span m='920000'>a three-second showing to say we're not going to do all this.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='925000'>And rather just to reinforce our focus, we're going to\
  \ limit</span> <span m='929000'>ourselves to a very finite part of the biosphere.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='934000'>And here is one way of depicting the biosphere. It's obviously\
  \ an</span> <span m='937000'>arbitrary way of doing so but it's quite illustrative.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='941000'>Here we start from molecules. And, in fact, we will occasionally</span>\
  \ <span m='944000'>go down to submolecular atoms. And here's the next dimension\
  \ of</span> <span m='948000'>complexity, organelles. That is these specialized little</span>\
  \ <span m='952000'>organs within cells. We're going to focus on them as</span> <span\
  \ m='955000'>well. We're going to focus on cells. And when we start getting to</span>\
  \ <span m='959000'>tissues, we're going to start not talking so much about them.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='963000'>And we're not going to talk about organisms and organs\
  \ or entire</span> <span m='967000'>organisms or higher complex ecological communities.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='972000'>And the reason we're doing that is that for 40 years in\
  \ this department,</span> <span m='976000'>and increasingly in the rest of the world\
  \ there is the acceptance of the</span> <span m='981000'>notion that if we understand\
  \ what goes on down here in these first</span> <span m='985000'>three steps, we\
  \ can understand almost everything else in principle.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>Of\
  \ course, in practice we may not be able to apply those principles to</span> <span\
  \ m='994000'>how an organism works or to how the human brain works yet.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='998000'>Maybe we never will. But, in general, if one begins to</span> <span\
  \ m='1002000'>understand these principles down here, one can understand much about</span>\
  \ <span m='1006000'>how organismic embryologic develop occurs, one can understand\
  \ a lot</span> <span m='1010000'>about a whole variety of disease processes, one\
  \ can understand how</span> <span m='1014000'>one inherits disease susceptibilities,</span>\
  \ <span m='1018000'>and one can understand why many organisms look the way they\
  \ do,</span> <span m='1022000'>i.e. the process of developmental biology.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1027000'>And so, keep in mind that if you came to hear about all\
  \ of these</span> <span m='1031000'>things, we're going to let you down. That's\
  \ not what this is going to be</span> <span m='1035000'>about. This also dictates\
  \ the dimensions of the universe that</span> <span m='1039000'>we're going to talk\
  \ about because we're going to limit ourselves to</span> <span m='1043000'>the very,\
  \ very small and not to the microscopic. On some occasions</span> <span m='1047000'>we'll\
  \ limit ourselves to items that are so small you cannot see them in</span> <span\
  \ m='1051000'>the light microscope. On other occasions we may widen our</span> <span\
  \ m='1056000'>gaze to look at things that are as large as a millimeter,</span> <span\
  \ m='1060000'>but basically we're staying very, very small. Again, because we view,</span>\
  \ <span m='1065000'>correctly or not, the fact that the big processes can be understood\
  \ by</span> <span m='1070000'>delving into the molecular details of what happens\
  \ invisibly and cannot</span> <span m='1074000'>be seen by most ways of visualizing\
  \ things, including the light and</span> <span m='1079000'>often even the electron\
  \ microscope. Keep in mind that 50 years ago we</span> <span m='1084000'>didn't\
  \ know any of this, for all practical purposes,</span> <span m='1088000'>or very\
  \ little of this. And keep in mind that we're so close to this</span> <span m='1092000'>revolution\
  \ that we don't really understand its ramifications.</span> </p><p><span m='1096000'>I\
  \ imagine it will be another 50 years before we really begin to</span> <span m='1101000'>appreciate\
  \ the fallout, the long-term consequences of this</span> <span m='1105000'>revolution\
  \ in biology which began 51 years ago. And so you're part of</span> <span m='1109000'>that\
  \ and you're going to experience it much more than my generation did.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1114000'>And indeed one of the reasons why MIT decided about 10 or 12 years\
  \ ago</span> <span m='1118000'>that every MIT undergraduate needed to have at least\
  \ one semester of</span> <span m='1122000'>biology is that biology, in the same\
  \ way as physics and</span> <span m='1127000'>chemistry and math, has become an\
  \ integral part of every</span> <span m='1131000'>educated person's knowledge-base\
  \ in terms of their ability to deal with</span> <span m='1135000'>the world in a\
  \ rational way. In terms of public policy,</span> <span m='1139000'>in terms of\
  \ all kinds of ethical issues, they need to understand</span> <span m='1143000'>what's\
  \ really going on. Many of the issues that one talks</span> <span m='1146000'>about\
  \ today about bioethics are articulated by people who haven't</span> <span m='1149000'>the\
  \ vaguest idea about what we're talking about this semester.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1153000'>You will know much more than they will, and hopefully some time down</span>\
  \ <span m='1156000'>the road, when you become more and more influential voices in\
  \ society,</span> <span m='1160000'>you'll be able to contribute what you understood\
  \ here,</span> <span m='1163000'>what you learned here to that discussion.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1167000'>Right now much of bioethical discussion is fueled by\
  \ people who</span> <span m='1171000'>haven't the vaguest idea what a ribosome or\
  \ mitochondrion or even a</span> <span m='1175000'>gene is, and therefore is often\
  \ a discussion of mutually shared</span> <span m='1179000'>ignorance which you can\
  \ diffuse by learning some basics,</span> <span m='1183000'>by learning some of\
  \ the essentials. Here is the complexity of the cell</span> <span m='1187000'>we're\
  \ going to focus on largely this semester, which is to say the</span> <span m='1191000'>eukaryotic\
  \ rather than the prokaryotic cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1195000'>And this is\
  \ just to give you a feeling for the overall dimensions</span> <span m='1199000'>of\
  \ the cell and refer to many of the landmarks that will repeatedly be</span> <span\
  \ m='1203000'>brought up during the course of this semester.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1208000'>Here is the nucleus. The term karion comes from the</span> <span m='1211000'>Greek\
  \ meaning a seed or a kernel. And the nucleus is what gives the</span> <span m='1215000'>eukaryotic\
  \ cell its name. Within the nucleus, although not</span> <span m='1219000'>shown\
  \ here, are the chromosomes which carry DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1222000'>You\
  \ may have learned that a long time ago. Outside of the nucleus is</span> <span\
  \ m='1226000'>this entire vast array of organelles that goes from the nuclear membrane,</span>\
  \ <span m='1230000'>and I'm point to it right here, all the way out to the outside</span>\
  \ <span m='1234000'>of the cell. The outside limiting membrane,</span> <span m='1237000'>the\
  \ outer membrane of the cell is called the plasma membrane.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1241000'>And between the nucleus and the plasma membrane there is an enormous</span>\
  \ <span m='1244000'>amount of biological and biochemical activity taking place.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1248000'>Here are, for example, the mitochondria. And the</span>\
  \ <span m='1252000'>mitochondria, as one has learned, are the sources of energy\
  \ production</span> <span m='1255000'>in the cell. And, therefore, we'll touch on\
  \ them very</span> <span m='1259000'>briefly. This is an artist's conception of</span>\
  \ <span m='1263000'>what a mitochondrion looks like. Almost always artists' conceptions</span>\
  \ <span m='1267000'>of these things have only vague resemblance to the reality.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1272000'>But, in any case, you can begin to get a feeling for\
  \ what one thinks</span> <span m='1276000'>about their appearance. Here are mitochondria\
  \ sliced open</span> <span m='1281000'>by the hand of the artist. And, interestingly,\
  \ mitochondria</span> <span m='1285000'>have their own DNA in them. One now accepts\
  \ the fact that</span> <span m='1290000'>mitochondria are the descendents of bacteria\
  \ which insinuated themselves</span> <span m='1294000'>into the cytoplasms of larger\
  \ cells, roughly 1.5 billion years ago, and</span> <span m='1299000'>began to do\
  \ a specialized job which increasingly became the job of</span> <span m='1303000'>energy\
  \ production within cells. To this day, mitochondria retain</span> <span m='1307000'>some\
  \ vestigial attributes of the bacterial ancestors which initially</span> <span m='1311000'>colonized\
  \ or parasitized the cytoplasm of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1314000'>When\
  \ I say parasitized, you might imagine that the</span> <span m='1318000'>mitochondria\
  \ are taking advantage of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>But, in fact,\
  \ the mitochondria represent the essential sources of</span> <span m='1326000'>energy\
  \ production in the cell. Without our mitochondria, as you</span> <span m='1331000'>might\
  \ learn by taking cyanide, for example, you don't live for very</span> <span m='1336000'>many\
  \ minutes. And the vestiges of bacterial origins of mitochondria</span> <span m='1340000'>are\
  \ still apparent in the fact that mitochondria still have their own</span> <span\
  \ m='1345000'>DNA molecule, their own chromosome. They still have their own ribosomes</span>\
  \ <span m='1350000'>and protein synthetic apparatus, even though the vast majority\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1354000'>proteins inside mitochondria are imported from\
  \ the cytoplasm,</span> <span m='1359000'>i.e., these vestigial bacteria now rely\
  \ on proteins made by the cell at</span> <span m='1363000'>large that are imported\
  \ into the mitochondrion to supplement the</span> <span m='1368000'>small number\
  \ of vestigial bacterial proteins which are still made here</span> <span m='1373000'>inside\
  \ the mitochondrion and used for essential function</span> <span m='1377000'>in\
  \ energy production. Here is the Golgi apparatus.</span> </p><p><span m='1381000'>And\
  \ the Golgi apparatus up here is used for the production of membranes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1385000'>As one will learn throughout the semester, the membranes of a cell</span>\
  \ <span m='1388000'>are in constant flux and are being pulled in and remodeled and</span>\
  \ <span m='1392000'>regenerated. The Golgi apparatus is very important for that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1395000'>Here's the rough endoplasmic reticulum. That's important\
  \ for the</span> <span m='1399000'>synthesis of proteins which are going to be displayed\
  \ on the surface</span> <span m='1402000'>of cells, you don't see them depicted\
  \ here,</span> <span m='1406000'>or are going to be secreted into the extracellular\
  \ space.</span> </p><p><span m='1410000'>Here are the ribosomes, which I might have\
  \ mentioned briefly</span> <span m='1413000'>before. And these ribosomes are the\
  \ factories where proteins are made.</span> </p><p><span m='1417000'>Again, we're\
  \ going to talk a lot about them. And,</span> <span m='1421000'>finally, several\
  \ other aspects, the cytoskeleton. The physical</span> <span m='1425000'>integrity,\
  \ the architecture of the cell is maintained by a complex</span> <span m='1429000'>network\
  \ of proteins which together are considered to be the</span> <span m='1433000'>cytoskeleton.\
  \ And they enable the cell to have some rigidity,</span> <span m='1437000'>to resist\
  \ tensile forces, and actually to move.</span> </p><p><span m='1441000'>Cells can\
  \ actually move from one place to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='1444000'>They\
  \ have motile properties. They're able to move from one</span> <span m='1447000'>location\
  \ to another. The process of cell motility,</span> <span m='1451000'>if that's a\
  \ word you'd like to learn.</span> </p><p><span m='1461000'>Here is what a prokaryotic\
  \ cell looks like by contrast.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>And I just want to\
  \ give you a feeling. First of all,</span> <span m='1466000'>it looks roughly like\
  \ a mitochondrion that I</span> <span m='1468000'>discussed before. But you see\
  \ that there is the</span> <span m='1472000'>absence of a nuclear membrane. There's\
  \ the absence of the highly</span> <span m='1476000'>complex cytoarchitecture. Cyto\
  \ always refers to cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>There's the absence of\
  \ the complex cytoarchitecture that one associates</span> <span m='1485000'>with\
  \ eukaryotic cells. In fact, all that a bacterium has</span> <span m='1490000'>is\
  \ this area in the middle. It's called the nucleoid, a term</span> <span m='1494000'>which\
  \ you also will probably never hear in your lifetime.</span> </p><p><span m='1499000'>And\
  \ it represents simply an aggregate of the DNA of the</span> <span m='1502000'>chromosomes\
  \ of the bacterium. And, in most bacteria, the DNA</span> <span m='1506000'>consists\
  \ of only a single molecule of DNA which is responsible for</span> <span m='1510000'>carrying\
  \ the genetic information of the bacteria. There's no membrane</span> <span m='1514000'>around\
  \ this nucleoid. And outside of this area where the</span> <span m='1518000'>DNA\
  \ is kept are largely ribosomes which are important for protein</span> <span m='1522000'>synthesis.\
  \ There's a membrane on the outside of this called the</span> <span m='1526000'>plasma\
  \ membrane, very similar to the plasma membrane</span> <span m='1530000'>of eukaryotic\
  \ cells. And outside of that is a meshwork</span> <span m='1534000'>that's called\
  \ the outer membrane, it's sometimes called the cell wall</span> <span m='1538000'>of\
  \ the bacterium, which is simply there to impart</span> <span m='1542000'>structural\
  \ rigidity to the bacterium making sure that it doesn't explode</span> <span m='1546000'>and\
  \ holding it together. And then there are other versions</span> <span m='1550000'>of\
  \ eukaryotic cells. Here's what a plant cell looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='1554000'>And\
  \ it's almost identical to the cells in our body, except</span> <span m='1558000'>for\
  \ two major features. For one thing,</span> <span m='1562000'>it has chloroplasts\
  \ in it which are also, one believes now,</span> <span m='1566000'>the vestiges\
  \ of parasitic bacteria that invade into the cytoplasm of</span> <span m='1570000'>eukaryotic\
  \ cells. So, in addition to mitochondria</span> <span m='1574000'>which are responsible\
  \ for energy production in all eukaryotic cells,</span> <span m='1578000'>we have\
  \ here the chloroplasts which are responsible for harvesting light</span> <span\
  \ m='1582000'>and converting it into energy in plant cells. The rest of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1586000'>cytoplasm of a plant cell looks pretty much the same.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1590000'>One feature that I didn't really mention when I talked\
  \ about an</span> <span m='1594000'>animal cell is in the middle of the nucleus,\
  \ here you can see,</span> <span m='1598000'>is a structure called a nucleolus.\
  \ And a nucleolus, or the nucleolus</span> <span m='1602000'>in the eukaryotic cell\
  \ is responsible for making the large</span> <span m='1606000'>number of ribosomes\
  \ which are exported from the nucleus into the</span> <span m='1610000'>cytoplasm.\
  \ And, as I mentioned just before,</span> <span m='1614000'>the ribosomes are responsible\
  \ for protein synthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='1619000'>It turns out this is a\
  \ major synthetic effort on the part of most</span> <span m='1623000'>cells. Cells,\
  \ like our own, have between 5 and 10</span> <span m='1627000'>million ribosomes\
  \ in the cytoplasm. So it's an enormous amount of</span> <span m='1631000'>biomass\
  \ in the cytoplasm whose sole function is to synthesize proteins.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1635000'>As we will learn also, proteins that are synthesized by the</span>\
  \ <span m='1639000'>ribosomes don't sit around forever. Some proteins have long\
  \ lives.</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>Some proteins have lifetimes of 15 minutes\
  \ before they're degraded,</span> <span m='1647000'>before they're turned over.\
  \ One other distinction between our</span> <span m='1652000'>cells, that is the\
  \ cells of metazoa and metaphyta,</span> <span m='1656000'>are the cell walls, analogous\
  \ to the cell walls of</span> <span m='1660000'>bacteria, this green thing on the\
  \ outside. As I said before,</span> <span m='1664000'>we do not have cell walls\
  \ around our cells. And we will,</span> <span m='1668000'>as the semester goes on,\
  \ go into more and more details about</span> <span m='1672000'>different aspects\
  \ of this cytoarchitecture during the first</span> <span m='1676000'>half of the\
  \ semester. Here, for example,</span> <span m='1679000'>is an artist's depiction\
  \ of the endoplasmic reticulum.</span> </p><p><span m='1683000'>Why it has such\
  \ a complex name, I cannot tell you, but it does.</span> </p><p><span m='1687000'>It's\
  \ called the ER in the patois of the street. The ER.</span> </p><p><span m='1691000'>And\
  \ the endoplasmic reticulum is a series of membranes.</span> </p><p><span m='1694000'>Keep\
  \ in mind, not the only membrane in the cell is the plasma membrane.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1698000'>Within the cytoplasm there are literally hundreds of membranes</span>\
  \ <span m='1702000'>which are folded up in different ways.</span> </p><p><span m='1706000'>Here\
  \ you see them depicted. And one set of these membranes,</span> <span m='1710000'>often\
  \ they're organized much like tubes, represents the membranes of</span> <span m='1714000'>the\
  \ endoplasmic reticulum which either lacks ribosomes attached to</span> <span m='1718000'>it\
  \ or has these ribosomes attached to it which cause this to be called</span> <span\
  \ m='1723000'>the rough endoplasmic reticulum to refer to its rough structure which</span>\
  \ <span m='1727000'>is created by the studding of ribosomes on the surface.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1732000'>As we will learn, just trying to give you a feeling</span>\
  \ <span m='1735000'>for the geography of what we're going to talk about this semester,</span>\
  \ <span m='1739000'>these ribosomes on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum\
  \ are</span> <span m='1743000'>dedicated to the task of making highly specialized\
  \ proteins which</span> <span m='1747000'>are either going to be dispatched to the\
  \ surface of the cell where they</span> <span m='1751000'>will be displayed on the\
  \ cell's surface or actually secreted into</span> <span m='1755000'>the extracellular\
  \ space. Many of the proteins that are</span> <span m='1759000'>destined for our\
  \ body are not kept within cells but are released into</span> <span m='1763000'>the\
  \ extracellular space where they serve important functions,</span> <span m='1767000'>and\
  \ so we're going to focus very much on them.</span> </p><p><span m='1771000'>Here's\
  \ actually what some of these things look like in the electron</span> <span m='1775000'>microscope\
  \ to see whether we can either believe or fully discredit</span> <span m='1779000'>the\
  \ imaginations of the artists. Here's the rough endoplasmic</span> <span m='1783000'>reticulum\
  \ I showed you in schematic form before. And you can see why</span> <span m='1788000'>it's\
  \ called rough. All these black dots are ribosomes</span> <span m='1792000'>attached\
  \ on the outside. Here's the Golgi apparatus.</span> </p><p><span m='1796000'>You\
  \ see these vesicles indicated here. And a vesicle,</span> <span m='1800000'>just\
  \ to use a new word, is simply a membranous bag.</span> </p><p><span m='1805000'>And\
  \ keep in mind, by the way, that we're not going to</span> <span m='1808000'>spend\
  \ the semester with these highly descriptive discussions.</span> </p><p><span m='1812000'>Our\
  \ intent today is to get a lot of these descriptive discussions out of</span> <span\
  \ m='1816000'>the way so that we can begin to talk in a common parlance about many\
  \ of</span> <span m='1819000'>the parts, the molecular parts of cells and organisms.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1823000'>Here is the mitochondrion which we saw depicted before.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1827000'>It looks similar to, but not identical to the artist's</span>\
  \ <span m='1831000'>description of that. And keep in mind that the</span> <span\
  \ m='1834000'>mitochondrion in our cells, as I said before, are the</span> <span\
  \ m='1838000'>descendents of parasitic bacteria. Here's the endoplasmic reticulum,</span>\
  \ <span m='1842000'>and the way it would look, as it does in certain parts of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1846000'>cell when it doesn't have all of these ribosomes studded on\
  \ the</span> <span m='1849000'>surface. The endoplasmic reticulum here is involved\
  \ in making membranes.</span> </p><p><span m='1853000'>The endoplasmic reticulum\
  \ here is involved in the synthesis and export</span> <span m='1857000'>of proteins\
  \ to the cell's surface and for secretion, as</span> <span m='1861000'>I mentioned\
  \ before. Much of what we're going to talk</span> <span m='1865000'>about over the\
  \ next days is going to be focused on the nucleus of the</span> <span m='1869000'>cell,\
  \ that is on the chromosomes on the cell and on the material which</span> <span\
  \ m='1874000'>is called chromatin which carries the genetic material.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1879000'>So the term chromatin is used in biology to refer simply to the</span>\
  \ <span m='1883000'>mixture of DNA and proteins, which together constitutes the</span>\
  \ <span m='1888000'>chromosomes. So chromatin has within it DNA,</span> <span m='1893000'>it\
  \ has protein, and it has a little bit of RNA in it.</span> </p><p><span m='1897000'>And\
  \ we're going to focus mostly on the DNA in the chromatin,</span> <span m='1902000'>because\
  \ if we can begin to understand the way the DNA works and</span> <span m='1906000'>functions\
  \ many other aspects will flow from that.</span> </p><p><span m='1911000'>I mentioned\
  \ the cell's surface, and I just want to impress on you</span> <span m='1915000'>the\
  \ fact that the plasma membrane of a cell is much more complicated than</span> <span\
  \ m='1920000'>was depicted in these drawings that I showed you just before.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1925000'>If we had a way of visualizing the plasma membrane of\
  \ a cell,</span> <span m='1928000'>we would discover that it's formed from lipids.\
  \ We see such lipids</span> <span m='1932000'>there, phospholipids, many of them.\
  \ We'll talk about them</span> <span m='1936000'>shortly. That the outside of the\
  \ cell, there are many proteins,</span> <span m='1940000'>you see them here, which\
  \ thread their way through the plasma</span> <span m='1944000'>membrane, have an\
  \ extracellular and intracellular part.</span> </p><p><span m='1948000'>And these\
  \ transmembrane proteins, which reach from outside to inside,</span> <span m='1952000'>represent\
  \ a very important way by which the cell senses</span> <span m='1956000'>its environment.\
  \ This plasma membrane,</span> <span m='1959000'>as we'll return to, represents\
  \ a very effective barrier to segregate</span> <span m='1963000'>what's inside the\
  \ cell from what's outside of the cell to increase</span> <span m='1967000'>concentrations\
  \ of certain biochemical entities.</span> </p><p><span m='1971000'>But at the same\
  \ time it creates a barrier to communication.</span> </p><p><span m='1974000'>And\
  \ one of the things that cells have had to solve over the last 700</span> <span\
  \ m='1978000'>to 800 million years is ways by which the exterior of the cell is</span>\
  \ <span m='1982000'>able to send certain signals and transmit that information to\
  \ the</span> <span m='1986000'>interior of the cell. At the same time,</span> <span\
  \ m='1989000'>cells have had to use a number of different, invent a number of</span>\
  \ <span m='1992000'>different proteins, some of them indicated here,</span> <span\
  \ m='1996000'>which are able to transport materials from the outside of the</span>\
  \ <span m='1999000'>cell into the cell, or visa versa. So the existence of</span>\
  \ <span m='2002000'>the plasma membrane represents a boon to the cell in the sense\
  \ that</span> <span m='2005000'>it's able to segregate what's on the inside from\
  \ what's on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='2009000'>But it represents an impediment\
  \ to communication which had to be solved,</span> <span m='2013000'>as well as an\
  \ impediment to transport. And many of these</span> <span m='2017000'>transmembrane\
  \ proteins are dedicated to solving those particular problems.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2022000'>Here you see, once again an artist's depiction</span> <span m='2026000'>form,\
  \ aspects of the cytoskeleton of the cell. And when we talk about</span> <span m='2031000'>the\
  \ cytoskeleton we talk about this network of proteins which,</span> <span m='2035000'>as\
  \ I said before, gives the cell rigidity.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Keep in\
  \ mind that the prefix cyto or the suffix cyt refers always to</span> <span m='2044000'>cells.\
  \ Allows the cell to have shape. And here you can see this</span> <span m='2048000'>network\
  \ as depicted in one way, but here it's depicted actually much</span> <span m='2052000'>more\
  \ dramatically. And here you begin to see the</span> <span m='2057000'>complexity\
  \ of what exists inside the cell. Here are these proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='2061000'>These\
  \ are polymers of proteins called vimentin which are present in</span> <span m='2065000'>very\
  \ many mesenchymal cells. Here are microtubules made from</span> <span m='2069000'>another\
  \ kind of protein. Here are microfilaments,</span> <span m='2073000'>in this case\
  \ made of the molecule actin. And if we looked at</span> <span m='2077000'>individual\
  \ molecules of actin they would be invisible.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>This\
  \ is end-to-end polymerization of many actin molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2085000'>And\
  \ we're looking here under the microscope from one end of the cell</span> <span\
  \ m='2089000'>to the other end of the cell. And you can see how these molecules,</span>\
  \ <span m='2093000'>they create stiffness, and they also enable the cell to</span>\
  \ <span m='2097000'>contract and to move. Some people might think that the</span>\
  \ <span m='2100000'>interior of the cell is just water with some molecules floating\
  \ around</span> <span m='2104000'>them. But if you actually look at what's present\
  \ in the cell,</span> <span m='2108000'>more than 50% of the volume is taken up\
  \ by proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='2112000'>It's not simply an aqueous solvent\
  \ where everything moves around freely.</span> </p><p><span m='2116000'>It's a very\
  \ viscous slush, a mush. And it's quite difficult</span> <span m='2120000'>there\
  \ for many cells to move around from one part of the</span> <span m='2124000'>cell\
  \ to the other. Here you begin to get a feeling now</span> <span m='2127000'>for\
  \ how the connection, which we'll reinforce shortly in</span> <span m='2131000'>great\
  \ detail, between individual molecules and the cytoskeleton.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2135000'>And here you see these actin fibers. I showed them to you just moments</span>\
  \ <span m='2138000'>ago stretching from one end of the cell to the other.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2142000'>And each of these little globules is a single actin monomer\
  \ which</span> <span m='2146000'>polymerize end-to-end and then form multi-strand\
  \ aggregates to create</span> <span m='2150000'>the actin cytoskeleton. Here's an\
  \ intermediate filament and</span> <span m='2154000'>here's the microtubules that\
  \ are formed, once again giving us this</span> <span m='2158000'>impression that\
  \ the cell is actually highly organized and that that high</span> <span m='2163000'>degree\
  \ of organization is able to give it some physical structure and</span> <span m='2167000'>shape\
  \ and form. I think we're going to end today</span> <span m='2172000'>two minutes\
  \ early. You probably won't object.</span> </p>"
