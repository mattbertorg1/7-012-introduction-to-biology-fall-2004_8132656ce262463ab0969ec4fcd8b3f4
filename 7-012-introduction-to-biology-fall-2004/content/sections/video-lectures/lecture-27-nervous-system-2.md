transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning. Thank you. So, I want to continue today
  on the</span> <span m='8000'>theme of neurobiology. Last time we spoke about the
  action</span> <span m='16000'>potential mechanism. Today I'd like to go from action</span>
  <span m='24000'>potential to the synapse. But let me briefly remind us what we</span>
  <span m='31000'>say. So, I'm going to give section zero a recap here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='37000'>The relevant things that we said last time was there's a membrane</span>
  <span m='44000'>potential which at rest is about minus 70 millivolts as the membrane</span>
  <span m='50000'>potential, and that's what we work with. That membrane potential
  is</span> <span m='56000'>set up by concentration gradients. More calcium, more
  potassium on the</span> <span m='63000'>inside. More sodium on the outside. More
  calcium on the outside. And</span> <span m='69000'>I'm also going to mention chloride,
  there's more chloride on the outside</span> <span m='76000'>at 116 millimolar, four
  millimolar on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='83000'>These concentration gradients
  are set up by various different pumps.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>They're there
  all the time. Then we have this resting channel.</span> </p><p><span m='97000'>So,
  here we have transporters.</span> </p><p><span m='107000'>We have a resting potassium
  channel. It means that it's open all the</span> <span m='113000'>time. It's not
  activated by anything.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>That allows potassium to leave.
  Potassium leaves until it builds up</span> <span m='124000'>this membrane potential
  about minus 70. At that point it is</span> <span m='128000'>electrically unfavorable
  for more positive charges to go out into the</span> <span m='132000'>more positive
  environment. Notwithstanding the greater</span> <span m='137000'>internal concentration.
  And we reach an equilibrium</span> <span m='141000'>potential of minus 70. We then
  have some voltage-gated</span> <span m='145000'>channels.</span> </p><p><span m='152000'>And
  the voltage-gated channels come in two flavors here.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>We
  have the voltage-gated sodium channel. The voltage-gated sodium</span> <span m='162000'>channel
  opens itself up around minus 70. Oh, sorry,</span> <span m='167000'>around minus
  50. So, if you can get up to minus 50</span> <span m='173000'>it opens up. Then
  your sodium rushes in. It shifts the membrane</span> <span m='178000'>potential
  from minus 50 to zero to plus 50.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>The channel shuts.
  Somewhere around plus 30 or so</span> <span m='190000'>opens the potassium channel,
  the voltage graded potassium channel,</span> <span m='197000'>and allows the potassium
  to rush out and restore the resting potential.</span> </p><p><span m='203000'>The
  effect of this is that, if this is zero here, we have</span> <span m='210000'>a
  resting potential. If we climb up a little bit above it</span> <span m='216000'>we
  shoot up and then we come back down. And then a millisecond or so</span> <span m='220000'>later
  another action potential could go down that same neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='224000'>And,
  last of all, if we look along the length of an axon,</span> <span m='228000'>an
  action potential here causes charges to migrate over which</span> <span m='233000'>launches
  an action potential here which causes charges to migrate over</span> <span m='237000'>which
  etc., etc. propagates an action potential down</span> <span m='241000'>the length.
  It's a beautiful system.</span> </p><p><span m='246000'>And then the very last thing
  was that by insulating this we were able</span> <span m='250000'>to make the conduction
  velocity go faster by effectively making the</span> <span m='254000'>effective length
  be shorter there being a whole bunch of electrically</span> <span m='258000'>insulated
  regions. So, that's it. It's a beautiful</span> <span m='262000'>piece of engineering.
  How do we know any of this is true?</span> </p><p><span m='266000'>As an interesting
  side point,</span> <span m='269000'>I might just mention that when this was worked
  out,</span> <span m='273000'>this was worked out by two folks called Hodgkin and
  Huxley.</span> </p><p><span m='276000'>Hodgkin and Huxley won a Nobel prize for
  this beautiful work on</span> <span m='280000'>this squid giant axon which is the
  fastest axon that there is.</span> </p><p><span m='283000'>And here we're not talking
  about the giant squid somebody raised last</span> <span m='287000'>time. It's an
  ordinary squid. It has one big fat axon. It's</span> <span m='290000'>sufficiently
  big that you can just like stick a wire in the middle of</span> <span m='294000'>it
  and all that. It's a very big axon.</span> </p><p><span m='297000'>It's a very,
  very high diameter axon.</span> </p><p><span m='301000'>And they were able to measure
  these things electrically.</span> </p><p><span m='304000'>And on the basis of the
  electrical measurements they made in different</span> <span m='307000'>kinds of
  solutions, they were able to infer the</span> <span m='310000'>existence of sodium
  channels and potassium channels.</span> </p><p><span m='313000'>But this all happened
  mid 20th century. And they certainly</span> <span m='317000'>couldn't see any. They
  couldn't clone them.</span> </p><p><span m='320000'>They couldn't see anything.
  And so the notion that there were</span> <span m='323000'>individual molecular channels
  that swung open, did all this stuff was</span> <span m='326000'>an indirect inference,
  maybe kind of a little bit like</span> <span m='330000'>Mendel's inference of a
  gene or Sturtevant's inference</span> <span m='333000'>of genetic maps. But more
  recently people have come</span> <span m='337000'>along with an extraordinary technology,
  also these people won a</span> <span m='342000'>Nobel prize for this because it
  was way cool, which is called the Patch</span> <span m='347000'>Clamp. The patch
  clamp is the following ridiculously simple</span> <span m='352000'>technology. Suppose
  I were to make a glass pipette.</span> </p><p><span m='358000'>So, this is a cross-section
  of a glass pipette.</span> </p><p><span m='364000'>So, it goes around like that.
  And I could bring it up really</span> <span m='370000'>tight up against the membrane.
  And suppose I did it in such a way</span> <span m='376000'>that I could get a really
  great seal and I just have a teeny patch of</span> <span m='382000'>membrane. Suppose
  that teeny patch of membrane had just</span> <span m='388000'>one channel in it.
  And now, so this is a pipette,</span> <span m='395000'>suppose I were to rip off
  that patch of membrane from the cell,</span> <span m='401000'>poor cell, and have
  a glass pipette with a little patch of membrane on</span> <span m='408000'>its end
  with a single isolated ion channel. Now,</span> <span m='414000'>if I measured the
  current through this channel by putting it in an</span> <span m='421000'>appropriate
  solution, maybe I ripped off a resting</span> <span m='427000'>potassium channel,
  OK? If I put this in a potassium</span> <span m='433000'>solution and I apply a
  current, I apply a voltage difference, I</span> <span m='438000'>should be able
  to see a current. And you can actually measure a</span> <span m='443000'>current.
  Even more cool, if I do this and I've ripped off a</span> <span m='448000'>voltage-gated
  sodium channel, then it turns out that I ought to be</span> <span m='453000'>able
  to study its properties by changing the voltage on it and</span> <span m='458000'>measuring
  the current as a function of the voltage.</span> </p><p><span m='464000'>And, well,
  it turns out that if I do this I'm able to measure in resting</span> <span m='469000'>or
  in these voltage-gated channels current flows conductivities,</span> <span m='475000'>actually,
  what I'm really measuring is the conductivity of the channel</span> <span m='481000'>like
  this, I can see the channel opening and closing and opening and</span> <span m='487000'>closing
  quantily. I can measure quantily the</span> <span m='492000'>conductivity. That's
  not quantum mechanics. It's just quanta</span> <span m='498000'>measurements of
  the conductivity. What would happen if I had two</span> <span m='503000'>channels
  that had been ripped off? Now I'd see it go like this.</span> </p><p><span m='509000'>Well,
  maybe another one opens. Oops, now one closes. Now the</span> <span m='512000'>other
  one closes. And quite remarkably you can get</span> <span m='516000'>this. So, you
  can study single molecule, single molecular channels.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>You
  want to know how this channel opens and at what voltage it opens?</span> </p><p><span
  m='523000'>Just dial in the voltage and see if it's open. Do you want to know how</span>
  <span m='526000'>long it stays open? Just turn it on and see how long it</span>
  <span m='530000'>stays open. It's really cool. You want to see if any other</span>
  <span m='533000'>chemicals could affect it, any ions, any other intracellular or</span>
  <span m='537000'>extra cellular chemicals? You can do it.</span> </p><p><span m='541000'>So,
  the ability to study isolated single channels came along with</span> <span m='545000'>patch
  clamping. And what it allows is a tremendous</span> <span m='549000'>study of the
  biophysics of individual channels.</span> </p><p><span m='554000'>And, whereas,
  before people had to look at the total conductivity of an</span> <span m='558000'>entire
  axon. Now they're able, and from that infer the behavior of</span> <span m='562000'>single
  channels, now what they can do is study the</span> <span m='566000'>behavior of
  single channels and synthetically build up a picture of</span> <span m='571000'>the
  total conductivity of an axon from its individual components and</span> <span m='575000'>see
  if the components we've identified are sufficient to explain</span> <span m='579000'>the
  behavior that we see. Anyway, that's patch clamping.</span> </p><p><span m='585000'>Lots
  of fun. So, now, what I want to turn now to is signaling</span> <span m='591000'>at
  the synapse.</span> </p><p><span m='599000'>So, we have our cell body here. It's
  got its dendrites on it.</span> </p><p><span m='604000'>Here's our axon. We've managed
  to get an action</span> <span m='610000'>potential started on it and it moves all
  the way down.</span> </p><p><span m='615000'>Now we get here to one of the synaptic
  terminals.</span> </p><p><span m='621000'>The electrical signal makes it all the
  way to the synaptic terminal,</span> <span m='626000'>but how does it affect the
  post-synaptic cell?</span> </p><p><span m='632000'>Well, let's get a close-up of
  that.</span> </p><p><span m='640000'>Here we go. Here's the synaptic terminal. We've
  got our action</span> <span m='646000'>potential coming. Action potential coming.</span>
  </p><p><span m='652000'>And then it gets here. Action potential's arrived.</span>
  </p><p><span m='659000'>I would like to release chemicals into the synaptic cleft,</span>
  <span m='665000'>the space between the pre and the post-synaptic cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='672000'>I'd like to spill out chemicals that are neurotransmitters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='680000'>So, the pre-synaptic cell conveniently has vesicles,</span> <span m='688000'>little
  membrane-bound vesicles with prepackaged neurotransmitters.</span> </p><p><span
  m='697000'>OK? These prepackaged neurotransmitters have been</span> <span m='702000'>conveniently
  synthesized by the cell and they're just sitting there</span> <span m='707000'>waiting
  to be released in response to an action potential.</span> </p><p><span m='712000'>When
  the action potential comes, it causes these synaptic vesicles to</span> <span m='717000'>fuse
  --</span> <span m='728000'>-- with the membrane. And in fusing the insides become</span>
  <span m='735000'>continuous with the outsides, here's a little fusion picture here,</span>
  <span m='742000'>and the neurotransmitters leak out. OK?</span> </p><p><span m='750000'>How
  does it do that, though, mechanistically?</span> </p><p><span m='755000'>How in
  the world does an action potential cause these vesicles to</span> <span m='760000'>fuse
  with the membrane? Well, somehow it's got to read out</span> <span m='766000'>electrical
  activity into some kind of a chemical activity</span> <span m='771000'>intracellularly.
  Here's what it does.</span> </p><p><span m='777000'>When the electrical signal comes
  down, remember originally the</span> <span m='782000'>membrane potential is negative,
  but when an action potential comes</span> <span m='788000'>by what does it do to
  the membrane potential? It reverses it.</span> </p><p><span m='793000'>It makes
  it positive inside briefly. OK? So, this is the sign of an</span> <span m='799000'>action
  potential, an AP coming down.</span> </p><p><span m='804000'>In this membrane we
  have us another voltage-sensitive channel.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>This voltage
  sensitive channel is a voltage sensitive calcium channel.</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>OK?
  Who would like to design a voltage-sensitive calcium channel?</span> </p><p><span
  m='820000'>What should it do? What would you like to have its opening and closing</span>
  <span m='826000'>properties be? When does it open?</span> </p><p><span m='831000'>At
  a positive charge. So, when you get to a positive</span> <span m='837000'>membrane
  potential it swings open. And then what does it do?</span> </p><p><span m='842000'>Lets
  calcium move. Which way does calcium want to go?</span> </p><p><span m='847000'>In
  because it's more out. So, what's going to happen is in</span> <span m='851000'>response
  to the action potential calcium will rush in.</span> </p><p><span m='856000'>Now,
  calcium, you will recall, was in vanishingly small traces</span> <span m='861000'>inside,
  0.1 micromolar we said. And influx of calcium is a very</span> <span m='866000'>serious
  matter and it is sensed by variety of proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='871000'>In
  particular, there is, floating around in the</span> <span m='878000'>cell, a protein
  here called a calcium-dependent protein kinase.</span> </p><p><span m='885000'>The
  calcium-dependent protein kinase</span> <span m='892000'>is a protein that is capable
  of putting a phosphate group.</span> </p><p><span m='896000'>Its kinase puts a phosphate
  group on other proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>So, the calcium-dependent
  protein kinase over here will go along and</span> <span m='904000'>catalyze the
  addition of a phosphate group to other proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='908000'>So,
  it will enzymaticly catalyze this. But it only does so in the</span> <span m='912000'>presence
  of calcium. So, when there's calcium in the</span> <span m='916000'>cell, the calcium-dependent
  kinase is activated and it runs around and</span> <span m='920000'>sticks phosphate
  groups on specific target proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='924000'>You know where
  one of those target proteins lives? In the vesicles.</span> </p><p><span m='928000'>The
  vesicles happen to be a target for this. So,</span> <span m='932000'>the vesicles
  have a protein on them. And in one of these extraordinary</span> <span m='936000'>coincidences
  in molecular biology, the protein on the synaptic vesicle</span> <span m='940000'>happens
  to be called, coincidently, synapsin.</span> </p><p><span m='944000'>OK? It's not
  actually entirely a coincidence that it's called</span> <span m='948000'>synapsin.
  It was named synapsin because it was found on the synaptic</span> <span m='952000'>vesicles,
  obviously. And so what happens is when the</span> <span m='956000'>action potential
  comes down it causes the calcium channel to open</span> <span m='960000'>in response
  to positive voltage. Calcium comes in,</span> <span m='963000'>actives at the kinase.
  The kinase phosphorilates synapsin.</span> </p><p><span m='967000'>And now the phosphorilated
  form of synapsin likes to bind to something</span> <span m='971000'>in the membrane.
  That's it. How many of you still</span> <span m='975000'>know what a Rube Goldberg
  machine is? Good. OK. This is one of these</span> <span m='979000'>just great, well,
  others of you should look it up on</span> <span m='983000'>the Web because they're
  just great cartoons, the Rube Goldberg cartoons</span> <span m='987000'>about the
  machine where the rooster crows startling the cat which tugs</span> <span m='991000'>the
  thing with causes this to flop which causes the eggs to go in the</span> <span m='995000'>pan
  which causes the thing to cook which causes whatever.</span> </p><p><span m='999000'>And
  I always think about these in terms of great molecular Rube</span> <span m='1002000'>Goldberg
  machines. So, this is the Rube Goldberg</span> <span m='1006000'>machine that gets
  this synaptic vesicle to fuse there.</span> </p><p><span m='1009000'>OK? Good. Every
  bit of neurobiology has a molecular</span> <span m='1013000'>mechanism to be explained
  like this. So, now let's go onto the next</span> <span m='1017000'>bit. How does
  this signal gets sensed at</span> <span m='1021000'>the next cell? What are we up
  to?</span> </p><p><span m='1026000'>Number three. So, let's look at a specific junction.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1031000'>Instead of looking at the junction between two nerve cells,</span>
  <span m='1036000'>let me start with the junction between a nerve cell and a muscle</span>
  <span m='1042000'>cell, the neuromuscular junction. OK? So, I've now replaced my</span>
  <span m='1047000'>post-synaptic neuron by a muscle fiber here. This is</span> <span
  m='1052000'>a muscle fiber. So, when it spritzes out the stuff</span> <span m='1058000'>the
  neurons that innervate muscle fibers, actually,</span> <span m='1064000'>I'm going
  to expand that a bit, the neurons that innervate muscle</span> <span m='1071000'>fibers,
  here's the muscle, and I'll put it at some distance</span> <span m='1077000'>here,
  muscle, spray out a particular transmitter in response</span> <span m='1083000'>to
  the calcium influx. And that transmitter is called</span> <span m='1090000'>acetylcholine,
  henceforth ACH.</span> </p><p><span m='1097000'>Acetylcholine is spritzed out into
  the synaptic cleft and comes out.</span> </p><p><span m='1104000'>And what do you
  think acetylcholine is going to do?</span> </p><p><span m='1112000'>I've got to
  send the chemical signal to the next cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1115000'>I've
  got to somehow send that signal to the surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1119000'>It's
  going to bind to something on the next cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1123000'>You
  know the deal, right? So, it's going to have to</span> <span m='1127000'>bind to
  a protein on this cell. And, remarkably, what it binds to</span> <span m='1131000'>is
  called an acetylcholine receptor. OK? Very reasonable stuff. An</span> <span m='1135000'>acetylcholine
  receptor. The acetylcholine receptor happens</span> <span m='1140000'>to be an ion
  channel, but it's not a voltage-gated ion</span> <span m='1146000'>channel. It's
  not an ion channel that opens in response to the</span> <span m='1152000'>voltage.
  It's an ion channel that opens in response to acetylcholine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1158000'>It's what we'd call a ligand-gated ion channel because it's gated by
  a</span> <span m='1164000'>ligand, acetylcholine. So, this guy here is a ligand-gated</span>
  <span m='1171000'>ion channel which, when acetylcholine binds to it,</span> <span
  m='1179000'>swings open. And what it does is it allows in sodium.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1187000'>Bingo. Now, when sodium comes in what happens? Action potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1195000'>But what a second. This is a muscle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1204000'>All membranes have the machinery to</span> <span m='1212000'>have an
  action potential? Nah, liver cells are pretty passive.</span> </p><p><span m='1216000'>You
  do this to a liver cell it kind of sits there.</span> </p><p><span m='1221000'>But
  muscle cells do have an action potential mechanism.</span> </p><p><span m='1225000'>They
  do respond here like a neuron, an action potential. And so what</span> <span m='1230000'>happens
  when I open up some sodium channels to the resting potential</span> <span m='1234000'>of
  my muscle? What was the resting potential of my</span> <span m='1238000'>muscle?
  About minus 70. What happens when I open up these</span> <span m='1242000'>ligand-gated
  sodium channels? Sodium rushes in. What does it do</span> <span m='1245000'>to my
  membrane potential? It makes it more positive.</span> </p><p><span m='1249000'>What
  does that do? It triggers an action potential spreading</span> <span m='1252000'>throughout
  the muscle. And because the muscle has an</span> <span m='1256000'>action potential
  --</span> <span m='1264000'>-- all you have to do is manage to get this going in
  a little patch of</span> <span m='1269000'>the muscle and it spreads throughout
  the muscle fiber.</span> </p><p><span m='1274000'>One neuromuscular synapse will
  be sufficient to activate the muscle,</span> <span m='1279000'>in principle, because
  you have this action potential mechanism.</span> </p><p><span m='1284000'>And then
  when the action potential fires in the muscle it actually</span> <span m='1289000'>causes
  other channels to open, including some calcium channels.</span> </p><p><span m='1294000'>The
  calcium channels cause calcium to come in. The calcium causes your</span> <span
  m='1298000'>muscle to contract because of sliding of actins and myosins and</span>
  <span m='1302000'>things like that. That's how it works.</span> </p><p><span m='1307000'>That's
  this Rube Goldberg machine. All right. So, let's get ready.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1311000'>Let's fire. Let's send a neuromuscular signal down.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1315000'>Contract. Now here's the problem. I've got all this acetylcholine</span>
  <span m='1320000'>sitting around in my synapse activating the ligand-gated sodium</span>
  <span m='1325000'>channel causing sodium to come in, but I would like to relax my
  muscle,</span> <span m='1330000'>please. What are we going to do about this?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1336000'>I could trigger another channel,</span> <span m='1344000'>and
  maybe it could be a delayed acetylcholine activated yeah,</span> <span m='1348000'>dah,
  dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, that's possible. I could have it close</span> <span m='1352000'>itself.
  These are all perfectly reasonable possibilities,</span> <span m='1356000'>and we're
  going to refer them to the engineering committee.</span> </p><p><span m='1361000'>What
  else? You could get rid of the acetylcholine some other way.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1365000'>It turns out the latter is the solution here.</span> </p><p><span m='1369000'>We
  would like to have some enzyme that chews up the acetylcholine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1373000'>How about acetylcholinesterase? So, let's put acetylcholinesterase,</span>
  <span m='1379000'>ACHE, acetylcholinesterase in the synaptic cleft.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1386000'>Then when I spritz acetylcholine it gets to the other side,</span> <span
  m='1393000'>but very rapidly the acetylcholinesterase is degrading it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1399000'>And so it has a very short time of persistence in the synaptic</span>
  <span m='1406000'>cleft. OK? That works. So,</span> <span m='1412000'>that's how
  I run a neuromuscular junction. OK?</span> </p><p><span m='1417000'>So, acetylcholinesterase
  is very important. Now,</span> <span m='1422000'>again, as with many of the things
  I've talked about,</span> <span m='1427000'>we really know these things are true
  when we're able to inhibit them in</span> <span m='1432000'>different ways. So,
  I want to take a moment and</span> <span m='1437000'>talk about drugs and toxins.
  Because they help us to probe these</span> <span m='1443000'>different processes.
  Anybody ever have fugu?</span> </p><p><span m='1451000'>Does anybody know what fugu
  is? What's fugu? It's a blowfish.</span> </p><p><span m='1458000'>Right. It's a
  puffer fish eaten in sushi, and it's an extraordinary</span> <span m='1466000'>delicacy.
  And why is that? Right. Because it's one of the only</span> <span m='1472000'>sushis
  where you really have to worry about improper preparation,</span> <span m='1476000'>not
  just giving you food poisoning or a stomachache or something like</span> <span m='1480000'>that,
  but it's lethal prepared incorrectly. The reason it's lethal</span> <span m='1484000'>incorrectly
  prepared is because the blowfish has a specific poison</span> <span m='1488000'>called
  tetrodotoxin. So, if you eat sushi,</span> <span m='1492000'>so, in fact, chefs
  in Japan require a license to prepare fugu</span> <span m='1496000'>for customers.
  Every once, every couple of years</span> <span m='1501000'>some famous actor or
  personality prepares his or her own fugu and</span> <span m='1508000'>dies from
  it and it's in the papers. Seriously. This has happened to</span> <span m='1515000'>people.
  They're able to do this. Anyway, tetrodotoxin, tetrodotoxin</span> <span m='1522000'>is
  from puffer fish, fugu. Why does this stuff kill you?</span> </p><p><span m='1529000'>It
  turns out that what tetrodotoxin does, this wonderful poison from</span> <span m='1536000'>this
  sushi, is that it irreversibly binds, irreversible binding and</span> <span m='1543000'>inhibition
  of voltage-gated sodium channels.</span> </p><p><span m='1550000'>Why would this
  be an inadvisable thing to have?</span> </p><p><span m='1554000'>Suppose you irreversibly
  bound to and inhibited your sodium channels,</span> <span m='1559000'>your voltage-gated
  sodium channels, what would you be unable</span> <span m='1564000'>to accomplish?
  An action potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1569000'>This is ill-advised to be unable
  to accomplish an action potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>You can imagine
  that what it leads to then is a paralysis and a very</span> <span m='1579000'>serious
  one, and if it's irreversible this is not a good</span> <span m='1584000'>thing.
  There are other things. Has anyone ever fired poison darts</span> <span m='1589000'>in
  South American jungles? [LAUGHTER]</span> <span m='1594000'>Well, if you have, you
  would have tipped them with</span> <span m='1601000'>qurare. Qurare is used to make
  poison darts. What qurare does is</span> <span m='1608000'>it reversibly binds,
  still not good, but it's a</span> <span m='1615000'>reversible binder to the acetylcholine
  receptor and it</span> <span m='1622000'>prevents it, it blocks the binding of acetylcholine.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1630000'>Your acetylcholine receptors, therefore, cannot respond
  to your</span> <span m='1634000'>acetylcholine. What will that do?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1638000'>A flaccid paralysis because you're unable to move your muscles.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1642000'>So, if you were trying to shoot prey in the forest and
  you send the</span> <span m='1646000'>poison dart that has qurare, it will cause
  the animal to then</span> <span m='1650000'>flop over. Yes? Snakes. Ooh,</span>
  <span m='1656000'>what kind of snakes? Venomous steak snakes,</span> <span m='1663000'>yeah.
  [LAUGHTER] Like bungarus snakes, the really poisonous ones.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1670000'>So, it turns out, great question, that they make something called</span>
  <span m='1677000'>alpha-bungerotoxin. Venomous snakes,</span> <span m='1683000'>next
  thing on my list, exactly. The only improvement they</span> <span m='1689000'>make
  here is that this is an irreversible binder to the</span> <span m='1695000'>acetylcholine
  receptors. Very impressive stuff. Different</span> <span m='1701000'>stuff. We'll
  come back to jellyfish. But, basically,</span> <span m='1707000'>everything you
  know out there that's noxious is being noxious in some way</span> <span m='1713000'>that
  affects molecular biology. Not all of it affects the nervous</span> <span m='1717000'>system.
  Those of you who like to collect mushrooms may wish to avoid</span> <span m='1721000'>amanitas
  mushrooms. They make amanitas.</span> </p><p><span m='1725000'>Amanitan is an irreversible
  binder that affects polymerase,</span> <span m='1728000'>RNA polymerase. Not a good
  thing to lose either. So,</span> <span m='1732000'>all parts of this course have
  interesting poisons that will affect</span> <span m='1736000'>it but we'll focus
  on the poisons effecting neurobiology today.</span> </p><p><span m='1740000'>And
  then there's a human made thing. Do you remember the, well, those of</span> <span
  m='1746000'>who have heard of World War I, nerve gas or, in particular, who</span>
  <span m='1752000'>remember the attack in the Tokyo subways with sarin,</span> <span
  m='1759000'>a particular kind of nerve gas. Do you know what that stuff does?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1765000'>It is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1772000'>What would happen if I inhibited your acetylcholinesterase?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1776000'>The muscles tense up and I'm unable to relieve them because,</span>
  <span m='1780000'>just like I was doing there, because my acetylcholine is not</span>
  <span m='1784000'>broken down in the synapse. So, this is a nice menu of</span>
  <span m='1789000'>interesting poisons and fun facts to know and tell and good things
  to</span> <span m='1793000'>avoid. There are more drugs and things that we can come
  back to.</span> </p><p><span m='1797000'>So, now let's talk about, let's move onto
  other synapses.</span> </p><p><span m='1801000'>Let's take a look at nerve-nerve
  synapses.</span> </p><p><span m='1806000'>So, we looked at a nerve muscle</span>
  <span m='1816000'>synapse. What were the properties of this nerve muscle synapse?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1822000'>Well, it had the property that a single neuron innervates
  a single</span> <span m='1829000'>muscle fiber. All right? This was a one-to-one
  single fiber,</span> <span m='1835000'>sorry, single neuron, single fiber.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1842000'>When we get to nerve-nerve synapses, they're more complex.
  Multiple</span> <span m='1852000'>different nerve terminals may synapse upon the
  same neuron,</span> <span m='1862000'>as I indicated last time. There might be a
  thousand different</span> <span m='1871000'>nerve terminals synapsing on the dendrites
  of a postsynaptic cell,</span> <span m='1877000'>but let's look at one of them for
  a moment. Then we'll come back to how</span> <span m='1883000'>a thousand can work
  together. So, here's one.</span> </p><p><span m='1889000'>And here's my dendrite
  that I'm synapsing on here.</span> </p><p><span m='1895000'>The nerve terminal releases
  into, sorry, into the synaptic cleft some</span> <span m='1901000'>neurotransmitter.
  It turns out there's a wide variety</span> <span m='1907000'>of neurotransmitters
  that get released while the neuromuscular</span> <span m='1913000'>junction involves
  acetylcholine. One example that might be involved</span> <span m='1919000'>here
  is something called glutamate. What's glutamate?</span> </p><p><span m='1924000'>It's
  an amino acid. Glutamic acid. It's the ion of</span> <span m='1928000'>glutamic
  acid. That actually is a neurotransmitter.</span> </p><p><span m='1932000'>Ever
  have monosodium glutamate. Does anybody get a headache from</span> <span m='1936000'>monosodium
  glutamate? I do. That's because it's a</span> <span m='1940000'>neurotransmitter.
  It messes with brain chemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='1944000'>So, glutamate. Glutamate
  is released.</span> </p><p><span m='1948000'>And what is does is there is a channel
  on the post-synaptic cell</span> <span m='1955000'>that binds glutamate. And it,
  too, is a ligand-gated ion</span> <span m='1962000'>channel. And it could be, for
  example, a sodium channel.</span> </p><p><span m='1969000'>Other neurotransmitters
  might use other channels.</span> </p><p><span m='1976000'>What happens if I spritz
  some glutamate on a dendrite of a cell</span> <span m='1983000'>that has a glutamate-activated
  sodium channel?</span> </p><p><span m='1991000'>What will happen in that dendrite?
  Sodium will rush in causing the</span> <span m='1996000'>membrane potential to become
  depolarized and then positive and</span> <span m='2002000'>then causing an action
  potential? No. It turns out that that last</span> <span m='2008000'>bit doesn't
  happen because the dendrites don't have the action</span> <span m='2014000'>potential
  machine. The action potential machinery is</span> <span m='2021000'>interestingly
  confined to the axon. It's not found on the dendrites.</span> </p><p><span m='2029000'>So,
  when we spritz with glutamate, what will happen is if this is a</span> <span m='2038000'>glutamate-bearing
  synaptic terminal the membrane potential here will</span> <span m='2046000'>become
  locally positive. But it is not an explosive</span> <span m='2053000'>regenerative
  action potential because there are no voltage-gated</span> <span m='2059000'>sodium
  channels that are going to open in response to that local</span> <span m='2064000'>depolarization.
  So, it became a little positive</span> <span m='2070000'>over in this corner of
  the neuron. Now, if it gets a little positive</span> <span m='2075000'>over in this
  corner of the neuron, you know, it's going to draw some</span> <span m='2079000'>negative
  charges from over here, right, to offset that local</span> <span m='2083000'>positivity.
  But if it's just a local little patch of positive then</span> <span m='2088000'>it
  draws a little bit of negative charge. But is that going to be</span> <span m='2092000'>enough
  to depolarize over here? No. So what do you want to do?</span> </p><p><span m='2096000'>Have
  more. Suppose I have two glutaminergic</span> <span m='2101000'>synapses and they
  fire, it might be. Probably not.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>Maybe they have
  to fire at the same time. Maybe if I have a hundred out</span> <span m='2112000'>of
  a thousand. Imagine that I have a hundred</span> <span m='2117000'>different glutaminergic
  synapses that fired simultaneously then what</span> <span m='2122000'>will happen?
  I'll get positive charges at all of them.</span> </p><p><span m='2128000'>And maybe
  that's enough to draw some negative charge away from the axon</span> <span m='2132000'>and
  start an action potential going, or maybe not. Maybe you need two</span> <span m='2137000'>hundred.
  What if they don't fire at exactly the same moment?</span> </p><p><span m='2141000'>Well,
  the minute one fires it makes it locally positive,</span> <span m='2146000'>but
  then it starts restoring itself so that if they're separated in time</span> <span
  m='2150000'>they're not as effective as if they happen simultaneously.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2155000'>So, we have an extraordinary complex analog integration</span> <span
  m='2159000'>circuit here. The analogy integration circuit</span> <span m='2164000'>depends
  on the temporal arrival of these signals.</span> </p><p><span m='2168000'>And what
  else does it depend on? The number of the signals. So,</span> <span m='2172000'>let's
  get this down. We're going to integrate the</span> <span m='2176000'>signals here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2196000'>It'll depend on their timing, the number, and the geometry,</span>
  <span m='2200000'>because it turns out that doing it at different places in the,</span>
  <span m='2204000'>now, I drew my dendritic tree, the dendrites as all these little</span>
  <span m='2208000'>hairy spikes coming off the cell body, but the dendrites are vastly</span>
  <span m='2212000'>more complex than that. Some cells have elaborate dendritic</span>
  <span m='2216000'>trees. The dendritic tree,</span> <span m='2220000'>the dendrites
  of some neurons, here's the cell body, can go off in</span> <span m='2225000'>all
  sorts of wonderfully complex patterns. And it may be more</span> <span m='2230000'>effective
  to hit synapses close to the cell body or synapses on</span> <span m='2234000'>different
  parts of the tree. And so that the entire shape of</span> <span m='2239000'>that
  dendritic tree can have an effect, and where you're hitting it</span> <span m='2244000'>has
  an effect. So, whereas the action potential is</span> <span m='2249000'>a very simple
  thing, which you might say just replace it</span> <span m='2253000'>by a wire for
  our computer modeling studies, goodness,</span> <span m='2258000'>nobody has actually
  succeeded in building a perfect model of the</span> <span m='2262000'>integration
  properties of an dendritic arbor for a single neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>They
  can get guess and approximations.</span> </p><p><span m='2271000'>So, there's an
  amazing integration that's going on here.</span> </p><p><span m='2276000'>But it
  turns out that it's more complex than that because,</span> <span m='2280000'>you
  see, I said that we had these, say, glutamate neurotransmitters</span> <span m='2285000'>here
  that were causing positive charges to rush in.</span> </p><p><span m='2290000'>It
  turns out there are other neurotransmitters that activate</span> <span m='2298000'>other
  channels in the membrane. And, for example, there are some</span> <span m='2306000'>neurotransmitters
  that activate, like glycine, another amino acid</span> <span m='2314000'>activates
  ligand-gated chloride channels.</span> </p><p><span m='2323000'>So, glutamate, one
  amino acid activates sodium</span> <span m='2328000'>channels. Sodium rushes in.
  Glycine activates chloride channels.</span> </p><p><span m='2334000'>What will chloride
  do? It can come in.</span> </p><p><span m='2340000'>What will it do when it comes
  in? Negative. Oh, my goodness. So,</span> <span m='2346000'>when glycine is spritz
  on the post-synaptic cell chloride comes in</span> <span m='2352000'>and the cell
  becomes locally more negative. These are called</span> <span m='2358000'>inhibitory
  synapses.</span> </p><p><span m='2368000'>By contrast those that admit positive
  ions excitatory synapses.</span> </p><p><span m='2374000'>Neurons can have both
  inhibitory and</span> <span m='2382000'>excitatory synapses on their dendrites.
  So,</span> <span m='2387000'>the postsynaptic cell will be receiving positive signals,</span>
  <span m='2393000'>positive ions coming in from excitatory synapse and negative</span>
  <span m='2398000'>signals, inhibitory signals with negative ions coming in.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2404000'>The integration of charge in the dendritic arbor is an
  integration</span> <span m='2408000'>problem of the timing, number, geometry and
  sign,</span> <span m='2412000'>positive or negative, of these activation signals.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2416000'>That's what's going on. And what happens is the neuron</span>
  <span m='2420000'>integrates these signals, positive and negative. So,</span> <span
  m='2424000'>we'll make this one a glycine neuron, negative, negative, negative.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2429000'>All that integration takes place right over here in the
  region of the</span> <span m='2433000'>cell called the axon hillock, which is the
  first place that the</span> <span m='2438000'>action potential mechanism is found.
  And, of course, that integration is</span> <span m='2442000'>nothing more and nothing
  less than figuring out whether the membrane</span> <span m='2447000'>potential gets
  above minus 50. If it gets above minus 50 it fires.</span> </p><p><span m='2451000'>OK?
  Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2459000'>Does the nucleus participate in the, in what
  way would the nucleus</span> <span m='2462000'>participate?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2471000'>It's an interesting question. I mean the nucleus does, in a sense.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2474000'>The geometry of that cell body there has some effect on
  the</span> <span m='2477000'>electrical properties and all that, but if you think
  about the</span> <span m='2481000'>timescales. How often do neurons fire? At a frequency
  often of about</span> <span m='2484000'>a millisecond. So, that means everything
  I've just</span> <span m='2487000'>old you, this complex integration problem is
  occurring within</span> <span m='2491000'>a millisecond. The processes in the nucleus
  that I</span> <span m='2494000'>think about typically of transcription and translation
  and</span> <span m='2498000'>all that are operating several orders of magnitude
  more slowly than</span> <span m='2501000'>that. You know, they'll operate, even
  in the best of</span> <span m='2504000'>circumstances, at seconds, and often at
  more than</span> <span m='2508000'>that, minutes before you could get transcription
  and translation and</span> <span m='2511000'>stuff like that going. So, the nucleus,
  I think,</span> <span m='2514000'>for the most part, better get its act together
  by producing stuff and</span> <span m='2518000'>getting it out to the periphery,
  but probably through the expression</span> <span m='2521000'>of the genome can't
  do much in a relevant millisecond or so.</span> </p><p><span m='2525000'>But I wouldn't
  be shocked if some neurobiologist knows better than I</span> <span m='2528000'>do
  that nucleoli do something. I mean there are many cleaver</span> <span m='2531000'>things
  that are going on. I'm sure a cell has wasted anything,</span> <span m='2534000'>but
  with respect to the operations we've talked about probably not.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2537000'>OK? But I'm always reluctant to say something never happens in any</span>
  <span m='2541000'>possible way. All right. So, now how does all this get stuck</span>
  <span m='2544000'>together? Well, not only do we have this</span> <span m='2548000'>complex
  integration within the dendritic arbor but,</span> <span m='2553000'>of course,
  the neurons are stuck together into circuits themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='2559000'>If
  we had more time I would draw the circuit that you use to</span> <span m='2564000'>integrate
  complex functions in calculus, but not having much time</span> <span m='2569000'>I'm
  going to just go for a much simpler circuit here.</span> </p><p><span m='2574000'>I'm
  just going to go back to nerves and muscles. And here we go.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2580000'>Suppose I tap right here below your knee. What happens?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2586000'>There's a reflex. Let's at least get that going,</span> <span m='2592000'>OK?
  What happens is when I tap there above your patella,</span> <span m='2598000'>here's
  your kneecap here, there's a sensory neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='2604000'>The
  sensory neuron brings out a signal and it goes into the</span> <span m='2610000'>spinal
  column here. This is a reflex.</span> </p><p><span m='2615000'>It doesn't need to
  go up to your brain. You don't need to think a lot</span> <span m='2619000'>about
  it. And it goes into the spinal column here into the dorsal</span> <span m='2624000'>root
  ganglia. This is a cross-section.</span> </p><p><span m='2628000'>The, sorry, sensory
  neuron comes in here. And what it does is that</span> <span m='2633000'>sensory
  neuron makes a synapse, and actually another synapse, and it</span> <span m='2637000'>makes
  a synapse on a motor neuron. The motor neuron comes back and</span> <span m='2644000'>synapses
  on that very muscle. It is the simplest possible circuit.</span> </p><p><span m='2653000'>I
  sense, I send one sensory signal up into the spinal cord,</span> <span m='2663000'>there's
  an excitatory positive synapse onto a motor neuron,</span> <span m='2672000'>this
  motor neuron fires and contracts my muscle so I go back.</span> </p><p><span m='2682000'>At
  the same time, this guy makes another synapse,</span> <span m='2688000'>a positive
  excitatory synapse on a little cell that is an interneuron,</span> <span m='2695000'>that's
  an intermediate neuron. That intermediate neuron makes a synapse</span> <span m='2702000'>on
  a second motor neuron, but this is an inhibitory synapse.</span> </p><p><span m='2709000'>That
  motor neuron sends its process</span> <span m='2717000'>out and is affecting the
  opposite muscle. So now what happens?</span> </p><p><span m='2723000'>Let's get
  this straight. I hit over here.</span> </p><p><span m='2730000'>And the signal goes
  back to my spinal cord. The sensory neuron</span> <span m='2734000'>causes one motor
  neuron, directly by firing on it,</span> <span m='2738000'>to contract. It causes
  an interneuron to fire that inhibits</span> <span m='2742000'>the opposite motor
  neuron. What happens if you inhibit the</span> <span m='2746000'>opposite motor
  neuron? You relax the contraction,</span> <span m='2750000'>or you at least don't
  contract the opposite muscle.</span> </p><p><span m='2754000'>So, what happens is
  you send a positive signal to the muscle on one</span> <span m='2758000'>side and
  you inhibit the signal to the muscle on the other side.</span> </p><p><span m='2763000'>It's
  a very simple circuit. It's got one sensory neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='2767000'>Two
  motor neurons. One interneuron. It's got two positive excitatory</span> <span m='2771000'>synapses.
  It's got one negative inhibitory synapse.</span> </p><p><span m='2775000'>That's
  about it. Presumably, everything else that goes on in</span> <span m='2779000'>daily
  life is basically the same thing. This is probably what eating</span> <span m='2783000'>lunch
  is like, falling in love is like and things</span> <span m='2787000'>like that,
  although the details remain to be worked out for exactly</span> <span m='2791000'>how
  that stuff works. There is a large collection of,</span> <span m='2794000'>I give
  you the simple examples because obviously we don't know a</span> <span m='2798000'>lot
  of the complex examples. There is a lot more to this.</span> </p><p><span m='2802000'>If
  had time in the course we could go into what's known about more</span> <span m='2805000'>circuits.
  I joke. We know about the circuits that</span> <span m='2809000'>help you see vision,
  that allow you to pick up signals in</span> <span m='2813000'>your retina, transmit
  them back and reconstruct things with positive and</span> <span m='2816000'>negative
  signals that allow you to see a straight line,</span> <span m='2820000'>for example,
  and recognize a straight line.</span> </p><p><span m='2824000'>And there are patterns
  of cells that send positive signals and negative</span> <span m='2827000'>signals,
  and when you integrate them you can get a signal if and only if</span> <span m='2830000'>there's
  a straight line at this angle in your visual field.</span> </p><p><span m='2834000'>And
  people know about that kind of stuff, but some of the more complex</span> <span
  m='2837000'>stuff we don't know about. There are lots and lots of</span> <span m='2840000'>neurotransmitters,
  glutamate, glycine,</span> <span m='2844000'>histamine, serotonin. ATP can be a
  neurotransmitter.</span> </p><p><span m='2847000'>Adenosine can be a neurotransmitter.
  There are peptide neurotransmitters.</span> </p><p><span m='2851000'>Endorphins,
  oxytocins and even gases. Nitrous oxide is a neurotransmitter.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2855000'>And then some of the drugs you may know work by affecting these</span>
  <span m='2859000'>neurotransmitters. Prozac and the general class of</span> <span
  m='2864000'>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Prozac effects a</span> <span
  m='2868000'>specific process with a neurotransmitter.</span> </p><p><span m='2872000'>There's
  a neurotransmitter serotonin. After it's fired out,</span> <span m='2877000'>instead
  of acetylcholesterase being in the synapse destroying it or some</span> <span m='2881000'>other
  enzyme destroying it, it's taken back up by the cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2886000'>If
  you could inhibit the process by which you take up your serotonin</span> <span m='2889000'>again,
  the serotonin would last longer in your synapse and you would</span> <span m='2892000'>be
  happier, give or take, roughly speaking to the extent that</span> <span m='2895000'>more
  serotonin is a good thing. And that's what Prozac does.</span> </p><p><span m='2899000'>Actually,
  it's one of the things Prozac does. There's good evidence</span> <span m='2902000'>now
  that Prozac does other things, too, including causing neuronal cell</span> <span
  m='2905000'>growth, but that's a whole other story.</span> </p><p><span m='2909000'>There
  are things like cocaine. Cocaine is a bad thing because it</span> <span m='2912000'>inhibits
  certain sodium transporters and other things.</span> </p><p><span m='2916000'>And
  if you go through all of the different psychoactive drugs they're</span> <span m='2919000'>affecting
  different parts of these processes. So,</span> <span m='2923000'>for Friday I've
  invited a colleague who is a real neurobiologist,</span> <span m='2927000'>I'm not
  a card-carrying neurobiologist,</span> <span m='2930000'>to talk about some of the
  more far out things of learning and memory.</span> </p><p><span m='2934000'>Andy
  Chess who's a good friend and a colleague is going to talk about</span> <span m='2938000'>learning
  and memory. And then have a good time with him,</span> <span m='2942000'>and I'll
  see you subsequently.</span> </p>
