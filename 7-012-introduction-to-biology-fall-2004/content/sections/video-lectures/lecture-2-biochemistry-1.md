transcript: <p><span m='1000'>OK. So today we're going to spend a little bit of time
  on some</span> <span m='4000'>elementary chemistry just to develop our language
  that we use with one</span> <span m='8000'>another. And so when I say hydrogen bond,
  you don't stare blankly at me</span> <span m='12000'>and scratch your heads. Many
  of you have had this already.</span> </p><p><span m='16000'>For many of you this
  is a review, but it's a useful review.</span> </p><p><span m='20000'>We believe
  here at MIT of teaching things two or three times often,</span> <span m='24000'>the
  same subject matter, but at increasing levels of sophistication.</span> </p><p><span
  m='29000'>So I do this without apology. Our first issue here is how are</span> <span
  m='35000'>atoms and molecules held together? And the most familiar way by which</span>
  <span m='41000'>atoms and molecules are held together is, of course,</span> <span
  m='48000'>the covalent bonds. And covalent bonds have an energy of roughly 80</span>
  <span m='54000'>kilocalories per mole. And that's a rather strong energy to</span>
  <span m='60000'>hold together two atoms because the energy, the thermal energy,</span>
  <span m='65000'>that is the energy at, let's say, body temperature is about 0.6</span>
  <span m='70000'>kilocalories per mole. And, therefore, if you had a bond,</span>
  <span m='74000'>if there was something holding things together that was in this</span>
  <span m='79000'>range or two or three or four times higher then the simple thermal</span>
  <span m='84000'>energy at room temperature or at body temperature would be sufficient</span>
  <span m='89000'>to break apart such a bond. But, in fact, this energy,</span> <span
  m='94000'>the energy of a covalent bond is so much higher that it's highly</span>
  <span m='98000'>unlikely that thermal energy is going to break apart a preexisting</span>
  <span m='103000'>covalent bond. And I was just reading yesterday</span> <span m='108000'>about
  how people were analyzing the mitochondrial DNA from some</span> <span m='112000'>Neanderthal
  bones which were dug up. The last Neanderthal lived around</span> <span m='117000'>30,000
  years ago, our recently demised cousins.</span> </p><p><span m='122000'>And they
  were analyzing the DNA sequences. And they got out of</span> <span m='126000'>those
  analyses stretches of DNA that were 200, 300 nucleotides long.</span> </p><p><span
  m='131000'>And that really is stunning testimonial to the fact that under</span>
  <span m='135000'>very difficult conditions, nonetheless, complex biological</span>
  <span m='140000'>molecules are able to survive over astounding periods of time,</span>
  <span m='144000'>indeed those that are held together by the covalent bonds like
  this.</span> </p><p><span m='149000'>Of course, you remember the film Jurassic Park
  where they used PCR</span> <span m='153000'>reaction to resurrect the DNA of dinosaurs.
  That's a bit of a</span> <span m='157000'>fantasy since dinosaurs left us, I guess,
  about 150 million years ago,</span> <span m='162000'>something like that. There's
  a big difference,</span> <span m='166000'>obviously, between 300,000 and 150 million
  year ago.</span> </p><p><span m='171000'>Now, the fact is if you look at the way
  that molecules are actually</span> <span m='175000'>hooked up, for instance, let's
  look at a water molecule here.</span> </p><p><span m='180000'>Ideally there should
  be no charge on this molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='184000'>And, in fact, there
  is no net charge. But the truth of the matter</span> <span m='188000'>is, if one
  wants to get frank, that oxygen molecules, and we always</span> <span m='193000'>are
  here, that oxygen molecules have a greater affinity for electrons</span> <span m='197000'>than
  do hydrogen atoms, i.e., they are electronegative.</span> </p><p><span m='202000'>And,
  therefore, what this means is that the swarms of electrons that</span> <span m='206000'>are
  holding all this together at the orbitals are drawn more closely to</span> <span
  m='211000'>the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms, i.e., the protons are relatively</span>
  <span m='215000'>willing to give up their electrons. And what this means is that
  there's</span> <span m='220000'>an unequal distribution. And, as a consequence,
  there is a</span> <span m='224000'>fraction of a negative charge here at this end
  of the molecule and</span> <span m='228000'>there are fractions of positive charges
  here because it's not as if</span> <span m='232000'>they've totally given up the
  electrons, but the electrons are</span> <span m='236000'>shifted more in this direction.
  And this molecule is therefore</span> <span m='239000'>called a polar molecule by
  virtue of the fact that here it has a positive</span> <span m='243000'>pole and
  here it has a negative pole. There are other pairs of molecules</span> <span m='247000'>which
  are relatively equally electronegative.</span> </p><p><span m='250000'>For example,
  here, if we have a carbon and a hydrogen,</span> <span m='254000'>these two atoms
  are roughly equally matched in terms of their ability to</span> <span m='258000'>pull
  electrons away, one from the other. And,</span> <span m='262000'>as a consequence,
  there is no net shifting of charge.</span> </p><p><span m='265000'>And keep in mind
  that this delta I show here is only a fraction of an</span> <span m='269000'>electronic
  charge. It's not the entire electronic</span> <span m='273000'>charge moved over.
  But this has important consequences</span> <span m='277000'>for the entire biochemistry
  that we're about to get into both today</span> <span m='281000'>and on Monday. Important
  because polar molecules,</span> <span m='286000'>such as water like this, are able
  to dissolve certain compounds.</span> </p><p><span m='290000'>And nonpolar molecules,
  which have large arrays of these kinds of bonds</span> <span m='295000'>or carbon-carbon
  bonds, these are relatively insoluble in</span> <span m='300000'>water, and that
  has important consequences for the organization of</span> <span m='304000'>biological
  membranes. We might have a carbonyl bond here,</span> <span m='308000'>that is a
  C going to an O via a double bond. And here we have,</span> <span m='312000'>once
  again, a situation where the oxygen is far more avid in terms of</span> <span m='315000'>its
  willingness and interest in pulling electrons toward itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='319000'>And, therefore, the carbon gives up a little bit of the electron cloud</span>
  <span m='322000'>and it becomes slightly electropositive.</span> </p><p><span m='326000'>Whereas,
  the oxygen atom becomes slightly electronegative.</span> </p><p><span m='330000'>Now,
  the fact of the matter is that there are also other bonds that are</span> <span
  m='335000'>noncovalent and are much less energetic. For example,</span> <span m='340000'>let's
  talk for a moment about a hydrogen bond.</span> </p><p><span m='346000'>And it's
  perhaps easiest to demonstrate a hydrogen bond by</span> <span m='351000'>looking
  at the structure of two neighboring water molecules in a</span> <span m='357000'>solution
  of water of all things. And, the fact of the matter is,</span> <span m='362000'>let's
  say we draw one water molecule down here and one water molecule</span> <span m='366000'>down
  here. What will happen is that this oxygen atom over here by virtue</span> <span
  m='371000'>of its electronegativity will have a certain affinity for pulling this</span>
  <span m='375000'>hydrogen atom toward itself. And, in fact, what actually happens</span>
  <span m='380000'>in real life, whatever that is at the molecular level,</span> <span
  m='385000'>is that this hydrogen atom may actually be bouncing back and forth</span>
  <span m='389000'>between these two oxygens. It may be rapidly an interchange</span>
  <span m='394000'>between them. This interchange causes a strong association between</span>
  <span m='398000'>two neighboring water molecules. And, indeed, represents the reason</span>
  <span m='403000'>why water does not vaporize at room temperature because the water</span>
  <span m='408000'>molecules have a strong affinity or an avidity for one another.</span>
  </p><p><span m='412000'>And, therefore, just to take some illustrations out of the
  book,</span> <span m='417000'>this is the way it's illustrated in the book.</span>
  </p><p><span m='422000'>Probably good to have a screen down. And here you can see
  the way that</span> <span m='427000'>water molecules are actually arrayed in water.
  This is the lower</span> <span m='432000'>illustration here. Just to indicate to
  you that the</span> <span m='437000'>hydrogen atoms are not really the possession,
  the ownership of one</span> <span m='442000'>molecule of water. They're just constantly
  being</span> <span m='447000'>exchanged back and forth. And this back and forth
  exchange,</span> <span m='452000'>this sharing of a hydrogen atom is what enables
  a hydrogen bond of</span> <span m='457000'>roughly 5 kilocalories of energy per
  mole to hold things together.</span> </p><p><span m='463000'>5 kilocalories is not
  much. It's only one order of magnitude</span> <span m='466000'>above 0.6 rather
  than being two orders of magnitude.</span> </p><p><span m='470000'>And, therefore,
  if one raises the temperature to the level of boiling,</span> <span m='473000'>if
  the temperature is high enough, the thermal energy is high enough to</span> <span
  m='477000'>rip apart these kinds of associations.</span> </p><p><span m='481000'>Now,
  if we were to go back here to look at this carbonyl atom we would</span> <span m='485000'>find
  the following sort of situation. Here we have this unequal sharing</span> <span
  m='490000'>of electropositive and electronegative bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='495000'>Let's
  put an acidic group like this. This is a carboxylic acid right</span> <span m='500000'>here.
  Here we see a carbon bond to a hydroxyl here via</span> <span m='505000'>this oxygen
  atom. Here, once again,</span> <span m='510000'>we have an electronegative atom.
  And, in fact, if we talk about an</span> <span m='514000'>ionized acid, normally
  in the absence of ionization there would be</span> <span m='518000'>a net zero charge
  right here. But at neutral pH it may well be</span> <span m='522000'>the case that
  the association, for various reasons, between this</span> <span m='527000'>oxygen
  and this hydrogen will allow the hydrogen, or rather the proton,</span> <span m='531000'>the
  nucleus of the hydrogen atom to just wander away.</span> </p><p><span m='535000'>And,
  therefore, we can imagine there could be a net negative</span> <span m='539000'>charge
  here. A whole, this has one full electron,</span> <span m='544000'>electronegative
  charge here, the charge of one electron,</span> <span m='548000'>and this proton
  will have ionized, will have left the carboxylic group</span> <span m='552000'>in
  which it originated, and now we have an ionized acid</span> <span m='556000'>group.
  Either before or even after this ionization,</span> <span m='560000'>there is a
  strong affinity of the carboxyl group with the water around</span> <span m='564000'>it
  because let's look at what happened before the ionization</span> <span m='568000'>occurred.
  This carbon here is strong and</span> <span m='573000'>electronegative. And, therefore,
  it will participate</span> <span m='577000'>in hydrogen bonding to the water solvent
  here, i.</span> </p><p><span m='582000'>., this proton will be shared a bit between
  the oxygen of the water</span> <span m='586000'>molecule and the oxygen right here.
  Similarly, here this oxygen will be</span> <span m='591000'>slightly electronegative
  for the reasons I've just described.</span> </p><p><span m='595000'>And here, once
  again, there may be some weak hydrogen bonding going on.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>Although,
  not as effective as over here where we have a double-bond</span> <span m='604000'>where
  we have a lot of concentration of a cloud of electrons pulled</span> <span m='609000'>towards
  the oxygen atom. And this begins to give us clues as</span> <span m='613000'>to
  why certain molecules are soluble in water and others are insoluble.</span> </p><p><span
  m='618000'>For example, if we look at aliphatic compounds.</span> </p><p><span m='622000'>Let's
  look at a compound that's structured like this.</span> </p><p><span m='627000'>I
  guess most people would call this</span> <span m='634000'>pentane. And we can call
  it that, too. And this has no</span> <span m='638000'>electronegativity or positivity
  by virtue of the equal affinities of</span> <span m='642000'>these two kinds of
  atoms, that is the hydrogen and the carbons</span> <span m='647000'>for electrons.
  And as a consequence,</span> <span m='651000'>this will not be able to form any
  hydrogen bonds with a solvent around</span> <span m='655000'>it if the solvent happens
  to be water.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>So there's not good bonding here. And
  this will, in fact, also if one</span> <span m='665000'>puts this in a solution
  of water, this will cause all the water</span> <span m='670000'>molecules to line
  up in a certain way, almost a quasi-crystal around</span> <span m='675000'>the aliphatic
  molecule. They'll be ordered in a certain</span> <span m='681000'>layer around the
  aliphatic molecule without being able to form any</span> <span m='686000'>strong
  hydrogen bonds with them. And this ordering represents a loss</span> <span m='691000'>of
  chaos, a loss of entropy. Entropy is chaos. It's disorder.</span> </p><p><span m='696000'>It's
  what happens, let's say, at 10:55 when we all leave the room,</span> <span m='700000'>all
  of a sudden order becomes chaotic. And here,</span> <span m='705000'>before this
  lining up occurred, the water molecules were chaotically</span> <span m='710000'>arrayed
  throughout the solvent. After this lining up occurred there</span> <span m='715000'>was
  a loss of entropy, there was a loss of chaos.</span> </p><p><span m='720000'>And
  thermodynamics tells us that generally the ordering of molecules</span> <span m='723000'>is
  disfavored. And consequently we now have two</span> <span m='727000'>reasons why
  this molecule doesn't like to be in the midst of water.</span> </p><p><span m='731000'>First
  of all, it's unable to form hydrogen bonds with the solvent.</span> </p><p><span
  m='735000'>And second of all there is a decrease in the entropy,</span> <span m='739000'>in
  the chaos that occurs when this molecule directly confronts water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='743000'>And because of those two reasons it turns out that this molecule doesn't</span>
  <span m='747000'>like to be in water. The aliphatic molecule,</span> <span m='751000'>as
  one would call this in organic chemistry, doesn't like to be in</span> <span m='755000'>water.
  And a dislike of water is often called its hydrophobicity,</span> <span m='760000'>or
  we often call it hydro, might as well spell it right,</span> <span m='765000'>hydrophobic,
  i.e., it really hates to be in water.</span> </p><p><span m='769000'>In fact, class,
  there's a second meaning for</span> <span m='774000'>hydrophobia, or hydrophobic
  has a second meaning.</span> </p><p><span m='779000'>Every five years I ask a class
  to see who knows what the second</span> <span m='783000'>meaning of hydrophobia
  is. This is really obscure. Sorry?</span> </p><p><span m='787000'>Rabies, right.
  The TAs aren't allowed to answer that.</span> </p><p><span m='792000'>If somebody
  has rabies, at one stage of rabies, almost near</span> <span m='796000'>the terminal
  stage, the individual becomes hydrophobic</span> <span m='801000'>because he or
  she doesn't like to drink water, for reasons that are</span> <span m='805000'>obscure
  at least to me. Now, conversely,</span> <span m='810000'>molecules that have carboxyl
  group on it would be called hydrophilic.</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>And, as
  we'll see over this lecture and the next one,</span> <span m='820000'>these hydrophobic
  and hydrophilic tendencies tend to have great</span> <span m='825000'>affects on
  the overall behavior of molecules. Let's,</span> <span m='830000'>for example, imagine
  a situation where we have a long aliphatic tail</span> <span m='835000'>like this.
  In fact, these tails can go on in certain</span> <span m='840000'>aliphatic compounds.
  They can go on for 20 or even 30</span> <span m='845000'>carbons. And at the end
  of this, let's just put arbitrarily a</span> <span m='849000'>carboxyl group. And
  let's say we ionized it.</span> </p><p><span m='853000'>So here's an acidic group
  that's ionized. It's shed its proton.</span> </p><p><span m='857000'>It's actually
  acquired a negative charge. And now we have something,</span> <span m='861000'>this
  molecule is a bit schizoid. Because on one end of it,</span> <span m='865000'>it
  loves to be in water, the other end of it hates to be in water.</span> </p><p><span
  m='869000'>And this has strong affects. It's sometimes called amphipathic,</span>
  <span m='873000'>but we don't need to worry about that word. And,</span> <span m='877000'>therefore,
  this carboxyl head loves to stick its head,</span> <span m='882000'>to immerse its
  head in water. And these things, the aliphatic</span> <span m='886000'>portion hates
  to be in water. Now, as a consequence of these</span> <span m='891000'>rather conflicted
  feelings that these molecules have about water,</span> <span m='895000'>we can ask
  the question what happens when we put such molecules</span> <span m='899000'>actually
  into water? And what we see here is the</span> <span m='904000'>following. That
  if we were to construct, for example,</span> <span m='909000'>a molecule of the
  sort that has here, in this case we're talking about a</span> <span m='913000'>molecule
  that has two hydrophobic tails. We'll get into its detailed</span> <span m='918000'>structure
  shortly, but just imagine for a moment two</span> <span m='923000'>long hydrophobic
  tails out here ended with a hydrophilic head.</span> </p><p><span m='928000'>And
  under such situations, if we put thousands of these or</span> <span m='933000'>millions
  of these molecules into a solution of water,</span> <span m='938000'>what we will
  then see is, no pointer? All right. Pointer?</span> </p><p><span m='943000'>All
  right. What we will then see is that the hydrophilic head groups,</span> <span m='948000'>which
  are here depicted in red, will point their way outwards,</span> <span m='953000'>they
  will want to stick their heads in water.</span> </p><p><span m='959000'>And conversely
  the hydrophobic tails fleeing from the water will actually</span> <span m='963000'>associate
  one with the other. And so you have a structure that's</span> <span m='968000'>called,
  in this case, an a micelle where you form this</span> <span m='972000'>little globular
  sphere where the lipid tails are tucked inside.</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>And,
  therefore, are actually being shielded from any direct exposure to</span> <span
  m='982000'>water. This structure down here, the lipid bilayer, is actually, as</span>
  <span m='986000'>we will discuss in greater detail shortly, the overall topology
  of the</span> <span m='991000'>way most biological membranes are organized.</span>
  </p><p><span m='996000'>In fact, virtually all of them. Why is that? Because biological</span>
  <span m='1000000'>membranes separate two hydrophilic or two aqueous spaces.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1005000'>Thank you, sir. A gentleman you are. So here is an aqueous
  space</span> <span m='1010000'>and here is an aqueous space. And as we see the hydrophilic
  heads</span> <span m='1015000'>are immersed or sticking their heads into the hydrophilic
  space.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>This is called a lipid bilayer. And, obviously,
  it's highly</span> <span m='1024000'>effective for separately these two aqueous
  compartments.</span> </p><p><span m='1028000'>In eukaryotic cells, as I mentioned
  last time, there is an enormous</span> <span m='1032000'>premium placed on separating
  and segregating different aqueous</span> <span m='1036000'>compartments which is
  invariably achieved through the device of</span> <span m='1040000'>constructing
  these lipid bilayers. Here's a vesicle. A vesicle is</span> <span m='1044000'>more
  complicated than a micelle. Because if you look at the membrane</span> <span m='1048000'>lining
  the vesicle, you see it's actually a lipid</span> <span m='1052000'>bilayer, but
  one that in 3-dimensional space is actually a</span> <span m='1056000'>sphere. And
  in the case of this vesicle, we can well imagine that on</span> <span m='1060000'>the
  inside of the vesicle water is kept, can be stored,</span> <span m='1063000'>and
  on the outside of the vesicle water can be stored.</span> </p><p><span m='1067000'>And
  many of the membranes that we see within the cytoplasms themselves</span> <span
  m='1071000'>are actually constructed on this kind of design.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1075000'>So when we draw, for example, in this case the Golgi</span> <span m='1078000'>apparatus,
  which I mentioned to you in passing last time we met,</span> <span m='1082000'>each
  one of these membranes here, it's obviously drawn as a double</span> <span m='1085000'>line,
  but whenever you see a membrane indicated,</span> <span m='1089000'>implicit in
  that drawing is the fact that each one of these membranes is</span> <span m='1093000'>actually
  a bilayer. There are never any monolayers of</span> <span m='1096000'>lipids in
  living cells. Each one of these vesicles you see</span> <span m='1100000'>here is
  actually a lipid bilayer with an aqueous inside and,</span> <span m='1104000'>once
  again, aqueous on the outside. Again, much of the thermodynamic</span> <span m='1108000'>stability
  that allows these vesicles to remain intact rather than just</span> <span m='1114000'>diffuse
  apart is created by these hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces</span> <span m='1119000'>which
  tie such molecules together or will rip them apart.</span> </p><p><span m='1125000'>Now,
  in truth there are yet other kinds of forces that govern the</span> <span m='1131000'>affinity
  of molecules to one another. For example, let's imagine a</span> <span m='1136000'>situation
  where we have an ionized acid group of the sort we just</span> <span m='1142000'>talked
  about before. Now, by the way,</span> <span m='1147000'>here, let's say I'll draw
  the negative charge on one of these two</span> <span m='1151000'>oxygens, if you
  can see that. But the truth is that the electrons</span> <span m='1155000'>are swarming
  back and forth, and so the negative charge is shared</span> <span m='1159000'>equally,
  the negative one electron charge is shared equally between</span> <span m='1163000'>these
  two oxygen atoms. And this is obviously an area of</span> <span m='1167000'>great
  electronegativity. Independent of that,</span> <span m='1172000'>let's imagine up
  here we have a basic group, let's say an amine</span> <span m='1176000'>group over
  here. And, the fact of the matter is,</span> <span m='1180000'>amine groups, NH2
  groups, that's what an amine is,</span> <span m='1184000'>here's an amine group.
  This is a carboxylic group.</span> </p><p><span m='1188000'>And the amine group,
  which is used very often in biochemistry,</span> <span m='1192000'>actually has
  an affinity. It has an unpaired set of electrons on the</span> <span m='1196000'>nitrogen,
  and so it likes to attract protons to it,</span> <span m='1200000'>which makes it,
  causes it to be called basic.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>And this attraction,
  the scavenging of protons,</span> <span m='1208000'>perhaps from the water, will
  obviously give this whole group here</span> <span m='1212000'>a net positive charge,
  a charge equal to the charge of one</span> <span m='1216000'>proton. Here, once
  again, we can imagine this is</span> <span m='1220000'>hydrophilic because this
  charge group can once again also associate</span> <span m='1224000'>quite intimately
  with aqueous solvent.</span> </p><p><span m='1229000'>Now, independent of any other
  forces that might exist here,</span> <span m='1233000'>indeed one could imagine
  situations where there is a sharing of a proton.</span> </p><p><span m='1237000'>And,
  therefore, a hydrogen bond formed between these</span> <span m='1241000'>two. Independent
  of that is the simple electrostatic interaction of</span> <span m='1245000'>these
  two groups. That is the mutual attraction of</span> <span m='1250000'>positive and
  negative groups, one to the other. And the</span> <span m='1254000'>electrostatic
  interactions, you cannot quantify exactly how many</span> <span m='1258000'>kilocalories
  a mole there is because the energetic value in electrostatic</span> <span m='1262000'>interaction
  is equal to one over r squared where r is the distance</span> <span m='1266000'>between
  these two charged groups. And obviously the further apart you</span> <span m='1271000'>get
  the weaker the attraction with one another. There are also what</span> <span m='1275000'>are
  called van der Walls interactions. There are largely of</span> <span m='1279000'>interest
  to a very small community of biochemists.</span> </p><p><span m='1283000'>You probably
  will never, you may never hear this term again</span> <span m='1287000'>in your
  life. And van der Waals interactions come</span> <span m='1292000'>from the fact
  that if we were to have, for example,</span> <span m='1296000'>two molecules over
  here which are not normally charged in any way,</span> <span m='1300000'>let's just
  talk about two aliphatic chains again. And I won't put in</span> <span m='1304000'>all
  the protons and everything, but just imagine a situation like</span> <span m='1309000'>this.
  What will happen is that because of the fluctuations of</span> <span m='1313000'>electrons,
  because the electrons are swimming around here all the time,</span> <span m='1317000'>moving
  from one area to the next they're never equally distributed</span> <span m='1322000'>homogenously
  over a long period of time, there will be brief instance</span> <span m='1326000'>in
  time, microseconds or even nanoseconds when there happens to be</span> <span m='1330000'>more
  electrons over here than right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1335000'>Just by chance.
  And this area of unequal</span> <span m='1339000'>distribution of electrons will
  in turn induce the opposite kind of</span> <span m='1343000'>electron shift in a
  neighboring molecule down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1347000'>Obviously, depending
  on the distance between them.</span> </p><p><span m='1351000'>But the negative here
  will repel electrons down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1354000'>The positive here
  will attract electrons down here.</span> </p><p><span m='1358000'>And so you will
  have these two quasi-polar arrangements here and</span> <span m='1362000'>here,
  very ephemeral, that is lasting for a very short</span> <span m='1366000'>transient
  period of time. But, nonetheless, sufficient to</span> <span m='1370000'>give a
  very weak interaction between these two molecules which may</span> <span m='1374000'>persist
  only for a microsecond and then be dissipated because the</span> <span m='1378000'>charges
  then redistributed once again.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>And, as a consequence
  of that, one has very weak interactions which,</span> <span m='1386000'>in the great
  scheme of things, play only a very minor role in the</span> <span m='1391000'>overall
  energy which holds molecules together. Now,</span> <span m='1396000'>with that background
  in mind, let's begin to elaborate on it,</span> <span m='1401000'>on how we can
  make molecules that have interesting properties that</span> <span m='1405000'>enable
  them, among other things, to participate in the construction</span> <span m='1410000'>of
  lipid bilayers, which will be the first object of</span> <span m='1415000'>our attentions
  today in terms of actual biochemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='1420000'>So here's
  a fatty acid. We see that up here. I,</span> <span m='1424000'>in effect, drew you
  the structure of a fatty acid up here already once</span> <span m='1428000'>before.
  And what we can see is through a linkage known as</span> <span m='1433000'>esterification
  we can create this molecule. So what do I</span> <span m='1437000'>mean by esterification?
  Well, in this case we're talking</span> <span m='1442000'>about a situation here
  where we have a carbon atom over here like this</span> <span m='1447000'>with a
  hydroxyl group. You see it over here. And what</span> <span m='1452000'>we're doing
  is we're dehydrating this, we're pulling out one net</span> <span m='1457000'>molecule
  of water. And each time we do that,</span> <span m='1462000'>on three separate occasions,
  what we end up doing is to create</span> <span m='1467000'>instead of this is to
  create a covalent bond between these two.</span> </p><p><span m='1472000'>And so
  the end product of dehydrating this,</span> <span m='1476000'>pulling out one net
  molecule of water is that we end up with a</span> <span m='1480000'>structure that
  looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1488000'>And you see that happening on at
  least three different occasions,</span> <span m='1493000'>here, here and here. Well,
  actually, I should put a carbon over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1498000'>So here
  we have three esterifications.</span> </p><p><span m='1502000'>The hydroxyl group
  in each case is reacting with a carboxyl group here</span> <span m='1507000'>pulling
  out one water, and each case creating what's called</span> <span m='1511000'>triacylglyercol
  or triglyceride. Triglyceride refers to the fact</span> <span m='1516000'>that we
  started here with a glycerol and we have now esterified it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1521000'>Now, in fact, there are two directions here in this</span> <span m='1525000'>kind
  of reaction. Esterification is the kind of</span> <span m='1530000'>linkage that
  we just showed here. And the truth is that vast numbers</span> <span m='1534000'>of
  biochemical linkages are made by esterification reactions and</span> <span m='1538000'>reversed
  by reactions that are called simply hydrolysis.</span> </p><p><span m='1543000'>And,
  in this case, what we're referring to is the fact that if one</span> <span m='1547000'>were
  to reintroduce a water molecule into each of these three linkages,</span> <span
  m='1551000'>one, two and three, we would break the bond and cause this entire</span>
  <span m='1556000'>structure to revert to the two precursors that existed or</span>
  <span m='1560000'>preexisted prior to these three esterification reactions.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1565000'>And time and again you'll see, over the next weeks, that</span>
  <span m='1570000'>esterification reactions are important for constructing different</span>
  <span m='1576000'>kinds of molecules. Now, the fact of the matter is we</span> <span
  m='1582000'>can do other kinds of modifications of a glycerol like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1588000'>Here what we've done, instead of adding a third fatty acid,</span>
  <span m='1592000'>note what was done here. Here through an esterification,</span>
  <span m='1596000'>let's look up at this one here, instead of adding a third fatty
  acid,</span> <span m='1600000'>we've saved, we've reserved one of the three groups
  of the glycerol.</span> </p><p><span m='1604000'>Here's what we saw just before.
  We've saved one of the three groups</span> <span m='1608000'>of the glycerol and
  put on instead this highly hydrophilic phosphate</span> <span m='1612000'>group,
  once again through a dehydration reaction, an</span> <span m='1616000'>esterification
  reaction. And now what we've done is add</span> <span m='1620000'>insult to injury
  because in the absence of this phosphate it would</span> <span m='1624000'>have
  a hydroxyl here which is mildly hydrophilic. But now look how</span> <span m='1627000'>strongly
  charged this is. Here are two negative charges,</span> <span m='1631000'>one electron
  each. And this is already a bit electronegative.</span> </p><p><span m='1634000'>So
  here we have an extremely potent hydrophilic entity.</span> </p><p><span m='1638000'>And
  here the degree of schizophrenia between one end of the</span> <span m='1641000'>molecule
  and the other is greatly exaggerated. Here,</span> <span m='1645000'>in fact, this
  is extremely hydrophilic.</span> </p><p><span m='1649000'>And, as a consequence
  of that, this really likes to stick its head</span> <span m='1653000'>inside water.
  And when we therefore talk about, we draw the images of</span> <span m='1657000'>different
  kinds of membranes, like this I showed you before the</span> <span m='1661000'>two
  tails. Here you saw the two tails I drew before in that diagram.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1666000'>Here's what we can imagine they actually look like in more real</span>
  <span m='1670000'>molecular terms. And the hydrophilic heads sticking</span> <span
  m='1674000'>in the water, this is just repeating what we saw before,</span> <span
  m='1678000'>become even more hydrophilic if we look at a molecule like this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1683000'>Let's look at this thing here. Here's a very long hydrophobic
  tail.</span> </p><p><span m='1687000'>Here are the two glycerols once again. Here
  is the phosphate.</span> </p><p><span m='1691000'>And keep in mind that phosphate
  obviously has these extra oxygens.</span> </p><p><span m='1695000'>Phosphate can
  react with more than just one partner,</span> <span m='1699000'>the glycerol down
  here. In this case we've added this group</span> <span m='1703000'>up here. And
  this group up here is, once again, this happens to be a</span> <span m='1707000'>serine
  which is an amino acid, this also happens to be quite</span> <span m='1711000'>hydrophilic.
  Here's our old friend the basic</span> <span m='1715000'>amino group. Here's the
  carboxyl group. This is a bit hydrophobic,</span> <span m='1719000'>CH2. And then
  we once again have the hydrophilic head here.</span> </p><p><span m='1723000'>And,
  therefore, we imagine, if we look at what's called a</span> <span m='1727000'>space-filling
  model, and a space-filling model really is</span> <span m='1730000'>intended to
  show us what one imagines if one had this vision,</span> <span m='1734000'>which
  we don't have, how much space each of these atoms would actually</span> <span m='1738000'>take
  up if one were able to see them.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>And here we see
  this space filling model. This lipid molecule here is</span> <span m='1747000'>actually
  slightly kinked with its hydrophilic head tucked into the</span> <span m='1752000'>water
  space. And so here's actually the way that many biological</span> <span m='1758000'>membranes
  look in terms of the way that they are constructed.</span> </p><p><span m='1763000'>Now,
  the fact of the matter is this also affords the cell the ability to</span> <span
  m='1768000'>segregate contents on one or the other side of whatever lipid bilayer</span>
  <span m='1774000'>it happens to have constructed. And here we can see about the</span>
  <span m='1779000'>semi-permeability, how permeable these membranes are to</span>
  <span m='1784000'>different kinds of molecules. Permeability obviously refers to</span>
  <span m='1789000'>the ability of this membrane to obstruct or to allow the migration</span>
  <span m='1794000'>of molecules from one side to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='1800000'>Ions,
  and these ions we see right here are obviously highly</span> <span m='1803000'>hydrophilic
  by virtue of their charge. That's explains,</span> <span m='1807000'>in fact, why,
  for example, table salt goes so readily into</span> <span m='1811000'>solution,
  because it readily ionizes into sodium, NA and CL,</span> <span m='1815000'>which
  then are avidly taken up by the water molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1818000'>So
  these are highly hydrophilic ions. And the questions is,</span> <span m='1822000'>can
  they go from one side of the membrane to the other?</span> </p><p><span m='1826000'>And
  the answer is absolutely not or highly improbably. Why?</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>Because
  these are so highly hydrophilic, the water molecules</span> <span m='1833000'>love
  to gather around them and form hydrogen bonds and electrostatic</span> <span m='1837000'>bonds
  with them. And if one of these ions ventures</span> <span m='1840000'>over here,
  it's going from an area where it's warmly embraced by the</span> <span m='1844000'>solvent
  molecules to an area where these molecules intensely dislike</span> <span m='1847000'>these
  ions. And, therefore, thermodynamically the</span> <span m='1851000'>entrance of
  any one of these ions into the membrane,</span> <span m='1855000'>into the hydrophobic
  portion of the membrane is highly disfavored,</span> <span m='1858000'>which makes
  the membrane essentially, for all practical purposes,</span> <span m='1862000'>impermeable.
  The same can be said of glucose</span> <span m='1865000'>which happens to be a carbohydrate.
  We'll talk about it shortly. But</span> <span m='1869000'>it's also nicely hydrophilic.
  It also can go in water. In fact,</span> <span m='1872000'>it can go through. And
  it's actually the case,</span> <span m='1875000'>to my knowledge, that one doesn't
  really understand to this day why</span> <span m='1879000'>lipid bilayers are reasonably
  permeable to water.</span> </p><p><span m='1882000'>You would say, well, water shouldn't
  be able to go</span> <span m='1886000'>through. It clearly doesn't have to have
  a</span> <span m='1889000'>net positive or negative charge, but the physical chemist,
  if you</span> <span m='1892000'>asked them why does water, why is water able to
  go through</span> <span m='1895000'>lipid bilayers? They'll say, well,</span> <span
  m='1898000'>we've been working on that and we'll get you an answer in the next five</span>
  <span m='1901000'>or ten years. And they said that 40 years ago and 30 years ago,</span>
  <span m='1904000'>and they're still saying it. And we don't really understand why</span>
  <span m='1907000'>water goes through, which is an embarrassment because</span> <span
  m='1910000'>here's one of the fundamental biochemical properties of living</span>
  <span m='1913000'>matter that is poorly understood. Gases can go right through.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1916000'>And amino acids, ATP, glucose 6 phosphate,</span> <span
  m='1920000'>highly hydrophilic, can also not go through. Now,</span> <span m='1925000'>the
  advantage of this is that a cell can accumulate large concentrations</span> <span
  m='1929000'>of these molecules either on the inside or it can pump them to the</span>
  <span m='1934000'>outside. In other words, it can create great gradients in the</span>
  <span m='1939000'>concentrations of different kinds of ions. For example,</span>
  <span m='1943000'>in many cells, the concentration of calcium, CA++ is a thousand
  times</span> <span m='1948000'>higher on the outside of the cell than on the inside
  of the cell which</span> <span m='1953000'>is a testimonial to how impermeable these
  lipid bilayer membranes are.</span> </p><p><span m='1958000'>The fact of the matter
  is I'm fudging a little bit here because in</span> <span m='1961000'>the lipid bilayers
  of the plasma membrane of the cell,</span> <span m='1965000'>the outer membrane
  of the cell that we talked about in passing last time,</span> <span m='1969000'>there
  are ion pumps which are constantly working away pumping ions</span> <span m='1973000'>from
  one side to the other overcomes the little bit of leakage which may</span> <span
  m='1977000'>have occurred if a calcium ion happens to have snuck through in one</span>
  <span m='1981000'>direction or the other. And we end up expending a lot of</span>
  <span m='1985000'>energy to keep these ion gradients in appropriate concentrations
  on the</span> <span m='1990000'>outside and the inside. In fact, virtually all the
  energy</span> <span m='1995000'>that is expended in our brain, almost all of it
  is expended to</span> <span m='2000000'>power the ion pumps which are constantly
  insuring that the</span> <span m='2005000'>concentrations of certain ions on the
  outside and the inside of</span> <span m='2010000'>neurons are kept at their proper
  respective levels.</span> </p><p><span m='2016000'>It could therefore be that actually
  more than half of our metabolic</span> <span m='2020000'>burden every day is expended
  just keeping the ions segregated on the</span> <span m='2024000'>outside and inside
  of cells. For example, potassium is at high</span> <span m='2028000'>levels inside
  cells, sodium is at high levels outside</span> <span m='2032000'>cells, just to
  site some arbitrary examples. There are also,</span> <span m='2036000'>by the way,
  as I mentioned last time, channels.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>And channels
  are actually just little doughnut shaped objects which</span> <span m='2044000'>are
  placed, inserted into lipid bilayers in the plasma membranes and</span> <span m='2048000'>just
  allow for the passive diffusion of an ion through them,</span> <span m='2053000'>through
  the doughnut hole enabling an ion, so if here's the lipid</span> <span m='2057000'>bilayer,
  not showing its two things, these kinds of doughnut shaped</span> <span m='2062000'>protein
  aggregates will allow the passage of ions in one</span> <span m='2066000'>direction
  or another. And here energy is not being</span> <span m='2071000'>expended to enable
  this passage. It may just be through diffusion.</span> </p><p><span m='2075000'>If
  there's a higher concentration of ion on side of the lipid bilayer</span> <span
  m='2079000'>and a lower one on this side, this diffusion will allow the ion to</span>
  <span m='2083000'>migrate through the bore of the ion channel from one side to the
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='2087000'>In fact, even though this does not involve
  the expenditure of energy on</span> <span m='2091000'>the part of the cell, the
  cell may actually use a gating</span> <span m='2095000'>mechanism to open or close
  these channels.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>When the channels are closed then
  the ions cannot move through.</span> </p><p><span m='2104000'>When the channels
  are gated open then diffusion can take over and</span> <span m='2108000'>insure
  the transfer, the transportation of ions from one</span> <span m='2112000'>side
  to the other. Now, having said that,</span> <span m='2117000'>we can begin to look
  at yet other higher level structures.</span> </p><p><span m='2121000'>Here, by the
  way, is a better drawing than the one I provided you.</span> </p><p><span m='2125000'>This
  comes from your book of what a vesicle looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>Here's
  what it looks like under the electron microscope and here's what</span> <span m='2134000'>it
  looks like when a talented rather than hapless and hopeless artist</span> <span
  m='2139000'>like myself tries to draw it. So let's just say that's our intro</span>
  <span m='2144000'>into lipids and membranes. And let's move onto the next layer</span>
  <span m='2149000'>of complexity. And the next layer of complexity in</span> <span
  m='2154000'>terms of molecules represents carbohydrates.</span> </p><p><span m='2159000'>And
  when we talk about a carbohydrate amongst ourselves we're</span> <span m='2163000'>talking
  about a molecule which, roughly speaking, has one carbon</span> <span m='2167000'>atom
  for every water molecule. And we'll shortly indulge ourselves</span> <span m='2171000'>in
  talking about all kinds of different carbohydrate molecules.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2175000'>Here is really one of the most important carbohydrate molecules,</span>
  <span m='2179000'>glucose. And what should we note about glucose?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2183000'>Well, the first thing you should see is that glucose has six carbon</span>
  <span m='2187000'>atoms. And, therefore, as a consequence it's called a</span> <span
  m='2191000'>hexose. We're going to talk about pentoses</span> <span m='2195000'>very
  shortly. They only have five, to state the obvious. Glycerol,</span> <span m='2199000'>which
  we talked about before, is also considered in one sense a</span> <span m='2204000'>carbohydrate,
  but it's been called by some people a triose.</span> </p><p><span m='2208000'>It
  only has three carbon atoms. And you can imagine, therefore, in</span> <span m='2213000'>principal
  that there are certain biochemical mechanisms which indeed</span> <span m='2217000'>exist
  which enable one to join two glycerol molecules,</span> <span m='2222000'>one to
  the other, to create something like a hexose, glucose.</span> </p><p><span m='2227000'>In
  fact, what we see from this drawing, expertly drawn by yours</span> <span m='2231000'>truly,
  is that the hexose molecule isn't really a linear molecule in</span> <span m='2236000'>solution.
  What happens is that because of various steric and</span> <span m='2240000'>thermodynamic
  forces it likes to cyclize. So let me just mention,</span> <span m='2245000'>I've
  just used two words that are useful to know about.</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>Steric
  or stereochemistry refers to the 3-dimensional structure of a</span> <span m='2254000'>molecule.
  And, obviously, the stereochemistry of a</span> <span m='2259000'>molecule is dictated
  by the flexibility with which participating</span> <span m='2263000'>atoms can form
  bonds, whether we have a trivalent atom</span> <span m='2268000'>like nitrogen or
  a tetravalent atom like carbon or a monovalent</span> <span m='2272000'>like hydrogen.
  And these structures,</span> <span m='2277000'>the stereochemistry is dictated both
  by what atoms are present here and</span> <span m='2283000'>by thermodynamic considerations
  which cause this particular hexose,</span> <span m='2288000'>indeed virtually all
  hexoses, to cyclize. When I say cyclize,</span> <span m='2293000'>obviously I mean
  to form a circular structure. Here we note one thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2299000'>You
  can see how the hydroxyl here actually attacks the positively</span> <span m='2304000'>charged
  carbon here in order to form this cyclic structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>You
  see one of the six points on this hexagonal structure here is</span> <span m='2316000'>oxygen.
  It's not carbon at all. So there is one oxygen and five</span> <span m='2323000'>carbons.
  And one of the carbons is relegated, is exiled to outside of</span> <span m='2329000'>the
  circle. It's sometimes called an extracyclic because it's sticking</span> <span
  m='2336000'>out from the actual circle. And this is the structure in which</span>
  <span m='2342000'>glucose actually exists inside cells. And, in fact,</span> <span
  m='2346000'>there is, in truth, two alternative ways by which</span> <span m='2350000'>glucose
  can cyclize, whether the oxygen attacks the</span> <span m='2354000'>carbon on the
  carbonyl group underneath or on top.</span> </p><p><span m='2358000'>And you see
  that gives us two alternative structures.</span> </p><p><span m='2362000'>What's
  different about them? Well, if we think about this hexose</span> <span m='2366000'>as
  existing in a plane, or the hexagon is in a plane</span> <span m='2370000'>In this
  case the oxygen is above the plane and the hydrogen is below the</span> <span m='2375000'>plane.
  With equal probability you can have these two atoms reversed</span> <span m='2380000'>where
  hydrogen is now above the plane and hydroxyl is below the</span> <span m='2385000'>plane.
  And both of these structures, these alternative structures can</span> <span m='2390000'>fairly
  be considered to be glucose. Now, let's get a little bit more</span> <span m='2395000'>complicated.
  Here we have fructose and we have galactose.</span> </p><p><span m='2400000'>And
  what we see here is, by the way, that we have exactly the</span> <span m='2404000'>same
  number of carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms but</span> <span m='2408000'>they're
  hooked up slightly differently. And here now we begin</span> <span m='2412000'>to
  get very picky about the disposition, the orientation of</span> <span m='2416000'>these
  different kinds of hydroxyls and hydrogens.</span> </p><p><span m='2420000'>And
  note, by the way, here that in many cases one doesn't</span> <span m='2424000'>even
  put in the H for the hydrogen. It's just implied by the end of</span> <span m='2428000'>this
  line. And here, if you were to look at</span> <span m='2431000'>this, you'll see
  here now we have two extra cyclic carbons.</span> </p><p><span m='2435000'>Here's
  galactose which is yet another hexose.</span> </p><p><span m='2438000'>These are
  all hexoses, but their stereochemistry creates</span> <span m='2441000'>quite different
  kinds of structures. And it turns out that this</span> <span m='2445000'>stereochemistry
  is extremely important. These molecules function</span> <span m='2448000'>very differently,
  one from the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2452000'>And, for example, to the extent
  that glucose is used</span> <span m='2455000'>in different kinds of energy metabolism
  and to the extent that</span> <span m='2459000'>galactose is not, there must be
  certain biochemical</span> <span m='2463000'>mechanisms in which one has catalysts,
  the catalysts that we</span> <span m='2467000'>call enzymes that ensure that one
  can convert one of these hexoses</span> <span m='2471000'>through an enzyme into,
  let's say a less useful one into a</span> <span m='2474000'>more useful one, glucose,
  which can readily be burnt</span> <span m='2478000'>up by the energy-generating
  machinery. Here we've gone yet</span> <span m='2482000'>another order of magnitude
  more complex because we've gone from a</span> <span m='2486000'>monosaccharide,
  i.e., one or another hexose,</span> <span m='2490000'>to a disaccharide. And here's
  common table sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='2494000'>And here you see that it's formed
  once again through an esterification</span> <span m='2498000'>reaction, i.e. there
  is a dehydration reaction</span> <span m='2502000'>between this hydroxyl here and
  this hydroxyl here.</span> </p><p><span m='2506000'>And biochemists take the orientation
  of these hydroxyl and</span> <span m='2510000'>hydrogen groups very seriously. Now,
  you can say they're a bit</span> <span m='2514000'>obsessive. Indeed they probably
  are.</span> </p><p><span m='2518000'>But, nonetheless, we can admit that the specific</span>
  <span m='2522000'>orientations of all these things dictate very importantly the</span>
  <span m='2527000'>difference between here, in this case sucrose, and in this</span>
  <span m='2531000'>case lactose. Why is this important? Well, this is the sugar in
  milk</span> <span m='2536000'>sugar. This is the dominant sugar in milk sugar,</span>
  <span m='2540000'>lactose. And half the world, as adults, cannot absorb this.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2545000'>All kinds of unpleasant things happen when they actually</span>
  <span m='2549000'>drink milk. How many people here are lactose</span> <span m='2554000'>intolerant?
  It's nothing to be ashamed of. I'm married to a very</span> <span m='2558000'>lactose
  intolerant person. She's otherwise very nice.</span> </p><p><span m='2563000'>The
  fact is that the enzyme to break down lactose,</span> <span m='2568000'>it's an
  enzyme which is called lactase. And here we have yet</span> <span m='2572000'>another
  nomenclature item. So lactase is the enzyme which</span> <span m='2577000'>breaks
  down lactose. And, by the way,</span> <span m='2582000'>this is just the harbinger
  of many other enzymes we're going to talk</span> <span m='2586000'>about in the
  future that end in A-S-E. Whereas,</span> <span m='2590000'>carbohydrates, many
  of them end in O-S-E, as you've already sensed.</span> </p><p><span m='2594000'>So
  it turns out that the enzyme lactase is made in large amounts by</span> <span m='2598000'>most
  mammals very early in life. Why? To be able to breakdown the</span> <span m='2602000'>milk
  sugar that comes in their mother's milk.</span> </p><p><span m='2607000'>But once
  mammals are weaned there's no reason on earth for them to</span> <span m='2610000'>continue
  to make lactase, in their stomach for example.</span> </p><p><span m='2614000'>And,
  as a consequence, in most mammals the production of lactase is</span> <span m='2618000'>shut
  down later in life. And for some weird quirk of human</span> <span m='2622000'>history,
  a significant proportion of humanity has learned how to retain</span> <span m='2626000'>the
  ability to make lactose through adulthood. And,</span> <span m='2630000'>as a consequence,
  people can go and have ice cream</span> <span m='2634000'>until the age of 70, 80
  or 90 without becoming very</span> <span m='2638000'>bloated. And we don't need
  to get into all</span> <span m='2642000'>the details, but you can begin to imagine.
  And what happens is,</span> <span m='2646000'>therefore, the lactase enzyme is shut
  down in their stomach.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>It depends. Sometimes they
  lose it at the age of 10 or 15 or 20.</span> </p><p><span m='2654000'>And then,
  for the rest of their lives, whenever they have a milk</span> <span m='2658000'>containing
  product, in fact, my son is also lactose</span> <span m='2662000'>intolerant. I'm
  surrounded by these people. Again,</span> <span m='2666000'>he is otherwise a tolerant
  person but he's lactose intolerant.</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>So this lactose
  molecule will go into the stomach,</span> <span m='2673000'>it will remain undigested,
  it will remain a disaccharide</span> <span m='2677000'>instead of being cleaved
  into two monosaccharides.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>The two monosaccharides
  are no problem because they can readily be</span> <span m='2684000'>interconverted.
  The galactose can be readily</span> <span m='2687000'>converted into glucose, and
  glucose is the universal</span> <span m='2691000'>currency of carbohydrate energy.
  And so this disaccharide passes</span> <span m='2694000'>through the stomach unaltered
  and it gets into the intestines,</span> <span m='2698000'>in the small intestine
  and the large intestine.</span> </p><p><span m='2702000'>And it turns out we have
  more bacterial cells in our gut than we</span> <span m='2706000'>have our own cells
  in the rest of the body. Imagine that.</span> </p><p><span m='2710000'>And there
  are a lot of bacteria that are waiting around in the gut</span> <span m='2714000'>for
  just a little gulp of lactose. And they never get it because most</span> <span m='2719000'>people
  break down their lactose long before it gets into the intestine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2723000'>But here we have these lactose intolerant people.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2728000'>The disaccharide gets into the gut and the bacteria go to town.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2731000'>They've been waiting around for years, decades for a little
  bit of</span> <span m='2735000'>lactose. And now it finally arrives and they go
  to town,</span> <span m='2739000'>ad they start metabolizing it and they ferment
  and they produce lots</span> <span m='2743000'>of gas and other kinds of byproducts.
  And, as a consequence,</span> <span m='2746000'>this makes people very uncomfortable.
  Just to show you,</span> <span m='2750000'>now, the fact is that lactose intolerance
  people can perfectly</span> <span m='2754000'>well break down sucrose, obviously.
  This is one of the great</span> <span m='2758000'>energy sources from plants. But
  they cannot break this down.</span> </p><p><span m='2761000'>And I emphasize that
  point to indicate that the stereochemical</span> <span m='2765000'>differences between
  different kinds of carbohydrates makes a very</span> <span m='2769000'>important
  difference. An enzyme like sucrase will break</span> <span m='2773000'>down the
  sucrose but it will not touch lactose.</span> </p><p><span m='2777000'>So there's
  a high degree of stereospecificity as it's called in</span> <span m='2781000'>the
  trade. Here we now go to another step forward that we're</span> <span m='2785000'>going
  to pursue in much greater detail next time.</span> </p><p><span m='2789000'>Because
  here, for the first time, we talk about polymerization. We're</span> <span m='2793000'>making
  polymers. Where the large number of hydroxyl</span> <span m='2798000'>groups on
  these monosaccharides affords one many opportunities to</span> <span m='2803000'>make
  very long linear aggregates end-to-end like this or even side</span> <span m='2808000'>branches.
  If you imagine that each one of these hydroxyls,</span> <span m='2813000'>in principle,
  represents a site for possible esterification,</span> <span m='2818000'>i.e., the
  formation of a bond to a neighboring side chain.</span> </p><p><span m='2823000'>Here
  we see these two linear chains and here we see the branch which is</span> <span
  m='2828000'>afforded, which is made possible by the availability of these unutilized</span>
  <span m='2833000'>hydroxyl side chains which are just waiting around to participate,</span>
  <span m='2838000'>if the opportunity allows them, in some kind of esterification</span>
  <span m='2843000'>reaction to form a covalent bond. Here is, by the way, glycogen,</span>
  <span m='2848000'>which is the way we store a lot of sugar in our liver.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2854000'>Here's a starch, which is what we get from many</span>
  <span m='2858000'>plants. And here's another very interesting polysaccharide.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2863000'>It's called cellulose. And we cannot digest cellulose,</span>
  <span m='2867000'>but termites can. And why they can is something we'll have to
  wait</span> <span m='2872000'>until next time to learn about. Have a great weekend.
  See you on</span> <span m='2876000'>Monday.</span> </p>
