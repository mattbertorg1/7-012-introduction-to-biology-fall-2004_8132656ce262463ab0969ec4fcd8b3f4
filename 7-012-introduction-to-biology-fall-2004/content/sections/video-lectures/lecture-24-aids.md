transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>It comes acquainted with different antigens.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='4000'>And recall that what we were talking</span> <span m='9000'>about\
  \ was the following, that there were several kinds of</span> <span m='13000'>phagocytic\
  \ cells. Phagocytic cells are cells that</span> <span m='18000'>chew up other things,\
  \ both macrophages and even more</span> <span m='23000'>frequently, dendritic cells,\
  \ many of which hang around lymph</span> <span m='27000'>nodes by the way. They\
  \ process antigens into</span> <span m='33000'>oligopeptides. The oligopeptides\
  \ get presented on</span> <span m='41000'>the surface of these cells. Let's say,\
  \ here's a macrophage,</span> <span m='48000'>in the form of through the class 2\
  \ MHC molecules which are displayed on</span> <span m='56000'>the surfaces of the\
  \ cells. And, here's a typical oligopeptide</span> <span m='62000'>that has been\
  \ chewed up from one of the antigens that was previously</span> <span m='67000'>internalized,\
  \ eaten up by the macrophage, a dendritic cell,</span> <span m='72000'>and then\
  \ presented on the surface. Recall, then, we have an itinerant</span> <span m='76000'>macrophage\
  \ or dendritic cell. Could we turn up the sound just a</span> <span m='81000'>little,\
  \ just a notch? Thank you. And this dendritic cell</span> <span m='86000'>or macrophage,\
  \ I'll just call it a macrophage for</span> <span m='91000'>the moment, is then\
  \ moving largely through the lymph nodes,</span> <span m='96000'>but wherever it\
  \ moves, it's carrying along this oligopeptide.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>And\
  \ recall that we liken this voyage of it to a Middle Eastern market</span> <span\
  \ m='105000'>where there's a lot of bazaar stalls on either side of the road,</span>\
  \ <span m='109000'>and where instead of the usual male merchants, there's a lot\
  \ of female</span> <span m='113000'>merchants hanging out. And these females are\
  \ called T</span> <span m='117000'>helper cells. They're a kind of T lymphocyte\
  \ or T</span> <span m='122000'>cell. TH refers to their function. And here, all\
  \ of these T helper</span> <span m='127000'>cells, I'll indicate each of them here\
  \ as a pink circle.</span> </p><p><span m='132000'>And these T helper cells display\
  \ on their surface to blow them up to a</span> <span m='137000'>large size a T cell\
  \ receptor that is organized much the way</span> <span m='142000'>immunoglobulin\
  \ molecule and antibody molecule's organized.</span> </p><p><span m='147000'>That\
  \ is to say, it has variable and constant regions.</span> </p><p><span m='153000'>It's\
  \ generated through the rearrangement of antibody-like genes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='158000'>But it only functions, this T cell receptor or as it's</span> <span\
  \ m='163000'>called in the trade the TCR, only functions to sense the presence</span>\
  \ <span m='168000'>of antigens in the extracellular space. In fact,</span> <span\
  \ m='173000'>it senses antigens in the context of the MHC class 2.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='178000'>So here's an MHC class 2 molecule. We can think of the MHC class 2\
  \ as</span> <span m='182000'>being a hand, which is presenting this oligopeptide.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='187000'>I haven't drawn a hand, but you can pretend it's a hand.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='192000'>And this MHC class 2 is being presented by either a macrophage\
  \ or</span> <span m='197000'>a dendritic cell. And recall, we talked about the</span>\
  \ <span m='201000'>voyage of this macrophage or dendritic cell through this street</span>\
  \ <span m='206000'>here, and all these T helper cells are kind of lazily waiting\
  \ along on</span> <span m='211000'>the sidelines looking at what this phagocytic\
  \ cell is hocking.</span> </p><p><span m='216000'>Most of the T helper cells are\
  \ totally uninterested in what he's</span> <span m='220000'>hocking. But one of\
  \ them is struck. It's love at first sight, this one</span> <span m='225000'>over\
  \ here, let's say, because her T cell receptor</span> <span m='230000'>precisely\
  \ recognizes this oligopeptide in the context of the</span> <span m='235000'>MHC\
  \ class 2 molecule. And, obviously I would like to draw</span> <span m='240000'>thousands\
  \ of these T helper cells here, each of which bears a</span> <span m='244000'>different\
  \ T cell receptor on her surface. I'm only showing one.</span> </p><p><span m='248000'>And\
  \ recall that after they make this encounter,</span> <span m='252000'>the T helper\
  \ cell gets all excited because she says,</span> <span m='256000'>oh, I can't believe\
  \ it, you have exactly the oligopeptide</span> <span m='260000'>that's recognized\
  \ by my receptor. And so, she gets all excited, and</span> <span m='264000'>what\
  \ she does is she proliferates because that's about all that</span> <span m='268000'>excited\
  \ cells can do. Well, they can do other things,</span> <span m='272000'>but again,\
  \ we don't want to talk about it. Anyhow,</span> <span m='277000'>so this particular\
  \ T helper cell undergoes a clonal expansion,</span> <span m='282000'>and is now\
  \ activated, i.e. activated not only psychologically but</span> <span m='287000'>physiologically\
  \ by having encountered the antigen-presenting</span> <span m='292000'>cell. The\
  \ MHC class 2, the macrophage is called an</span> <span m='297000'>antigen-presenting\
  \ cell. It's using its MHC class 2 molecules</span> <span m='302000'>to do so. Macrophages\
  \ and dendritic cells are pretty much similar in</span> <span m='307000'>this respect.\
  \ Macrophages go all over the body in the tissues.</span> </p><p><span m='313000'>Dendritic\
  \ cells tend to inhabit the lymph nodes. But from the point of</span> <span m='318000'>view\
  \ of our discussion today, we can imagine that they're</span> <span m='323000'>functionally\
  \ essentially equivalent. And having said that, now these T</span> <span m='328000'>helper\
  \ cells go looking for a congenial B cell.</span> </p><p><span m='334000'>So, now\
  \ we have a third actor in the drama, and the congenial B cell</span> <span m='339000'>looks\
  \ like this. And, the B cell has the following</span> <span m='344000'>thing. The\
  \ B cell has also on its surface, MHC class 2 molecules,</span> <span m='349000'>which\
  \ can be used in antigen presentation. But the B cell has an</span> <span m='355000'>addition\
  \ as we said last time, already, on its surface, IGM</span> <span m='360000'>molecules.\
  \ An IGM is a brand of antibody.</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>Keep in mind that\
  \ really one of the paradoxes that we haven't really</span> <span m='370000'>fully\
  \ settled on is the following question or the following issue.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='374000'>How is it that when a B cell sees a cognate antigen,</span> <span m='379000'>why\
  \ does it get stimulated? In other words, what is it that</span> <span m='384000'>induces\
  \ the B cell to start proliferating?</span> </p><p><span m='389000'>Here's another\
  \ version of what I showed you last time,</span> <span m='392000'>where a B cell\
  \ which makes the right antibody gets stimulated,</span> <span m='396000'>but a\
  \ B cell that doesn't does not get stimulated.</span> </p><p><span m='400000'>And\
  \ that's the issue we're wrestling with right now.</span> </p><p><span m='404000'>So\
  \ here on the surface of this B cell is an IGM molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='408000'>Keep\
  \ in mind an IGM molecule is an antibody molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='412000'>Immunoglobulin\
  \ means IG. It's the earliest form of antibody</span> <span m='416000'>that's made.\
  \ Once again, it is antigen specific.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>Its variable\
  \ region has been rearranged through the fusion of</span> <span m='425000'>different\
  \ VDJ segments and somatic hypermutation.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>And, this\
  \ B cell has a very interesting property.</span> </p><p><span m='435000'>This is\
  \ a na\xEFve cell, and what this B cell does is as</span> <span m='440000'>follows.\
  \ It moves around the body, and if this B cell happens to find</span> <span m='445000'>an\
  \ antigen, which is recognized by its antibody, the IGM antibody.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='450000'>Then the B cell will bind this antigen using its IGM molecule to do</span>\
  \ <span m='456000'>so. More importantly, it will then internalize this</span> <span\
  \ m='462000'>antigen and chew it up into little pieces, and then present it on it</span>\
  \ <span m='468000'>surface via the MHC class 2 molecule. So, let's just review what</span>\
  \ <span m='474000'>we've been saying. Before, we were talking about</span> <span\
  \ m='479000'>macrophages and dendritic cells, which gobbled up whatever they could,</span>\
  \ <span m='483000'>processed whatever they gobbled up, and put it on the surface\
  \ again as</span> <span m='487000'>MHC class 2, and therefore the macrophages and\
  \ the dendritic cells</span> <span m='491000'>are really like sewer rates. They'll\
  \ just chew on anything and</span> <span m='495000'>they'll put it on their surface.\
  \ They're totally promiscuous in what</span> <span m='499000'>they present on their\
  \ surface. But here, the B cell is doing</span> <span m='503000'>something rather\
  \ similar. But the B cell isn't presenting</span> <span m='507000'>whatever it happens\
  \ to stumble across on its surface.</span> </p><p><span m='511000'>The B cell is\
  \ extraordinarily selective at what it presents on its</span> <span m='515000'>surface.\
  \ It only presents on its surface those antigens which are</span> <span m='519000'>recognized\
  \ by its IGM molecule. So here, it uses its IGM molecule</span> <span m='524000'>to\
  \ grab hold of this antigen. It internalizes the antigen, and</span> <span m='528000'>then\
  \ presents it back on the surface as an MHC class 2 molecule.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='533000'>So, there's a profound contrast in the behavior of these two kinds\
  \ of</span> <span m='537000'>antigen-presenting cells. The macrophages and dendritic\
  \ cells,</span> <span m='542000'>they just gobble up everything, and whatever they\
  \ find,</span> <span m='546000'>they put on their surface. They don't care with\
  \ MHC class 2.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>The B cell is extraordinarily selective\
  \ and specific.</span> </p><p><span m='554000'>It will pull in not through regular\
  \ phagocytosis. It will pull in using</span> <span m='558000'>its IGM receptor,\
  \ specific antigens that are</span> <span m='562000'>recognized by its IGM molecule,\
  \ and then externalize it using its</span> <span m='566000'>MHC class 2 molecule\
  \ to do so. Let's go back to the drama of the</span> <span m='570000'>activated\
  \ T helper cell, and here's the activated T helper</span> <span m='574000'>cell.\
  \ We'll draw her in pink. The T helper cell has just had an</span> <span m='579000'>encounter\
  \ with a macrophage, or dendritic cell. And, she's just</span> <span m='583000'>left\
  \ this marketplace. And now, she's very excited.</span> </p><p><span m='588000'>So\
  \ here is her T cell receptor. And she's very excited. She's</span> <span m='593000'>putting\
  \ out all kinds of growth factors and multiplying</span> <span m='597000'>all over\
  \ the place. And she starts looking again now for</span> <span m='602000'>a B cell\
  \ with which he can react. Now, most of the B cells in the</span> <span m='606000'>body\
  \ will not have an epitope that she recognizes.</span> </p><p><span m='610000'>Most\
  \ of the B cells in the body will have picked up other kinds of</span> <span m='615000'>things\
  \ that happen to recognize by their T cell receptor,</span> <span m='619000'>and\
  \ will present it on the surface. A rare B cell will happen to</span> <span m='624000'>internalize\
  \ an antigen, and put on the surface, which is the</span> <span m='628000'>same\
  \ antigen that was recognized previously in the previous</span> <span m='632000'>encounter.\
  \ And so, now this T helper cell goes</span> <span m='637000'>around looking for\
  \ an attractive male. What's an attractive male for</span> <span m='642000'>her?\
  \ An attractive male for her is one whose MHC class 2 molecule is</span> <span m='647000'>recognized\
  \ directly in the context, and this oligopeptide is recognized</span> <span m='652000'>by\
  \ her T cell receptor. And so, she'll come over here and</span> <span m='657000'>she'll\
  \ say excitedly to the B cell, you can't believe what just happened.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='662000'>She will say, I was just there. I just went through the market.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='665000'>I was sitting there in the marketplace, and along came\
  \ a</span> <span m='669000'>macrophage, and presented me with an oligopeptide that\
  \ exactly fit in my</span> <span m='673000'>T cell receptor. And now, she says excitedly,</span>\
  \ <span m='677000'>here I find a B cell has exactly the same oligopeptide presenting\
  \ it to</span> <span m='681000'>me. Isn't that a coincidence? And the B cell says,\
  \ come on lady,</span> <span m='685000'>get to the point. And she says, I just had\
  \ an encounter with a</span> <span m='689000'>macrophage dendritic cell. I recognized\
  \ the same oligopeptide</span> <span m='693000'>in the macrophage dendritic cell\
  \ that you have.</span> </p><p><span m='697000'>And, the B cell says, well, I guess\
  \ this must be some kind</span> <span m='702000'>of meaningful encounter, and so\
  \ these two cells get together.</span> </p><p><span m='706000'>And what happens\
  \ now is that the T cell, having recognized the</span> <span m='711000'>oligopeptide,\
  \ presented on the surface of the B cell now begins to</span> <span m='715000'>send\
  \ out signals to stimulate the B cell to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='720000'>And\
  \ this B cell now begins to proliferate. And this B cell now</span> <span m='723000'>begins\
  \ to proliferate, as is indicated on this overhead,</span> <span m='727000'>and\
  \ eventually it starts making IGM molecules. It makes more of them,</span> <span\
  \ m='731000'>and then through the class switching that we talked about last time,</span>\
  \ <span m='735000'>it'll make eventually IGG secreted antibody gamma globulin molecules.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='739000'>So you see here the three essential cell types that participate\
  \ in this.</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>And why is it so complicated? Because\
  \ it's extraordinarily</span> <span m='746000'>important that the immune system\
  \ doesn't inadvertently make</span> <span m='750000'>antibodies that are inappropriate\
  \ to express, because as we said before,</span> <span m='754000'>if a certain of\
  \ those antibodies and indeed possibly many of them could</span> <span m='758000'>be\
  \ autoreactive. And what do I mean by autoreactive?</span> </p><p><span m='762000'>I\
  \ mean reactive with self. They could be antibodies that react with</span> <span\
  \ m='767000'>one's own tissues. And in so doing, they could create</span> <span\
  \ m='772000'>series kinds of autoimmune diseases. So, we have this sequence of</span>\
  \ <span m='777000'>failsafe reactions. So, when finally the decision for</span>\
  \ <span m='782000'>the B cell to get activated depends on a previous encounter with\
  \ the</span> <span m='786000'>same oligopeptide by a macrophage or dendritic cell,</span>\
  \ <span m='791000'>the T helper cell acting as an intermediary and now activating\
  \ the</span> <span m='795000'>B cell, once the T cell tells the B cell that the\
  \ T cell has had a</span> <span m='800000'>previous encounter with exactly the same\
  \ oligopeptide,</span> <span m='804000'>on that occasion being presented by a macrophage\
  \ or dendritic cell.</span> </p><p><span m='809000'>And that is actually the mechanism\
  \ by which we get this clonal</span> <span m='812000'>expansion of B cells in the\
  \ immune system, and ultimately how we get</span> <span m='816000'>the productive\
  \ antibody molecules. I mean, this is the image I showed</span> <span m='820000'>you\
  \ earlier, but I never really explained to you what the biology</span> <span m='824000'>behind\
  \ that is. I just said that antigen encounter</span> <span m='828000'>on the part\
  \ of the B cell causes that B cell to enjoy clonal</span> <span m='832000'>expansion.\
  \ And now, we've gone through the detail of</span> <span m='836000'>deciding how\
  \ three different cell types interact,</span> <span m='840000'>collaborate with\
  \ one another to create the antibody response because</span> <span m='844000'>this\
  \ B cell then goes on to produce IGM as it already is doing,</span> <span m='848000'>and\
  \ then eventually IGG, and possibly a series of other</span> <span m='852000'>immunoglobulins,\
  \ IGE and IGA which have other</span> <span m='857000'>purposes. Now, all of this\
  \ actually is an important</span> <span m='861000'>prelude to our main topic of\
  \ discussion today, which is</span> <span m='865000'>the disease of AIDS. And, let\
  \ me just add one other</span> <span m='870000'>detail to this because the ability\
  \ of a T helper cell to recognize MHC</span> <span m='875000'>class 2 molecules\
  \ depends on another cell surface molecule expressed by</span> <span m='879000'>the\
  \ T helper cell. And this other T cell surface</span> <span m='884000'>molecule\
  \ is called CD4. CD4, we don't have to worry of what</span> <span m='889000'>it\
  \ stands for. CD4 is not an antigen specific</span> <span m='894000'>receptor. CD4,\
  \ instead, only recognizes MHC class 2</span> <span m='899000'>molecules no matter\
  \ what they're carrying.</span> </p><p><span m='904000'>So, there are MHC class\
  \ 2 molecules which I've implied to you can carry</span> <span m='909000'>thousands\
  \ of different oligopeptides. CD4 doesn't care what's being</span> <span m='914000'>carried\
  \ by the MHC class 2. It just binds to MHC class 2</span> <span m='920000'>molecules,\
  \ thereby telling the T helper cell that an encounter has</span> <span m='925000'>been\
  \ made with an antigen-presenting cell.</span> </p><p><span m='931000'>So, the ligand\
  \ for CD4 is part of the MHC class 2 molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='936000'>Now,\
  \ that all leaves us in a very nice segue to the whole disease of</span> <span m='942000'>AIDS.\
  \ Let's just remember how the disease of AIDS was discovered.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='947000'>In 1981, there were a group of five young men who were all subsequently</span>\
  \ <span m='953000'>determined to be gay, be homosexual, who were discovered</span>\
  \ <span m='958000'>in San Francisco to have a very unusual kind of immunodeficiency.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='964000'>They all had night sweats. They got different kinds of</span>\
  \ <span m='968000'>otherwise unusual diseases. For example one of the things they</span>\
  \ <span m='972000'>got was a disease called Kaposi's sarcoma, which was otherwise\
  \ known</span> <span m='977000'>only in old southern Italian and Jewish men, Kaposi's\
  \ sarcoma.</span> </p><p><span m='981000'>But these were young men, and they were\
  \ neither southern Italian</span> <span m='985000'>nor Jewish. They got pneumocystis\
  \ carinii,</span> <span m='991000'>which is a microbial infection of the lung. And,</span>\
  \ <span m='997000'>in fact, they got all kinds of herpes virus infections.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1004000'>And they were all seen in a cluster by an alert physician\
  \ who saw</span> <span m='1010000'>something very unusual, and therefore said, perhaps</span>\
  \ <span m='1017000'>correctly, that they had acquired immunodeficiency.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1024000'>Now, this acquired immunodeficiency is a syndrome.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1025000'>A syndrome, by the way, for your information, is a whole</span> <span\
  \ m='1027000'>collection of symptoms that appear together. That's what a syndrome</span>\
  \ <span m='1029000'>means. So, this term AIDS came from the fact that they had a\
  \ whole</span> <span m='1031000'>series of symptoms. And, this was an acquired</span>\
  \ <span m='1033000'>immunodeficiency rather than a congenital immunodeficiency rather</span>\
  \ <span m='1035000'>than a congenital immunodeficiency because given the complexity\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1037000'>immune system, you can imagine correctly that\
  \ there</span> <span m='1039000'>are a lot of people in the world who were born\
  \ with congenitally</span> <span m='1041000'>defective immune systems that are immunodeficient\
  \ from birth because</span> <span m='1043000'>there's so many different proteins\
  \ involved in regulating all of these</span> <span m='1045000'>different immune\
  \ responses. But this was really different.</span> </p><p><span m='1047000'>It was\
  \ an acquired immunodeficiency. It was seen in a very special</span> <span m='1049000'>subgroup,\
  \ and so the race was on over the next two years to figure</span> <span m='1051000'>out\
  \ what was going on.</span> </p><p><span m='1082000'>Now, by coincidence, starting\
  \ in 1970-'71,</span> <span m='1086000'>retrovirus research had begun. And as it\
  \ turned out, retrovirus</span> <span m='1090000'>search, President Nixon's war\
  \ on cancer, retrovirus research was</span> <span m='1094000'>motivated largely\
  \ by the notion that human cancers are caused by</span> <span m='1098000'>retrovirus\
  \ infections. And, that led to the war on cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='1102000'>And\
  \ the notion behind the war on cancer was totally wrong because it</span> <span\
  \ m='1106000'>turns out that only a minute fraction of human cancers have</span>\
  \ <span m='1110000'>anything to do with retrovirus infections, although as we've\
  \ said</span> <span m='1114000'>earlier, retroviruses proved to be very important\
  \ tools experimentally</span> <span m='1118000'>for discovering proto-oncogenes\
  \ and oncogenes in the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='1123000'>But if you ask, what\
  \ fraction of human cancers are</span> <span m='1127000'>actually due to a human\
  \ being infected by a retrovirus?</span> </p><p><span m='1131000'>It's almost zero.\
  \ It's a small fraction of a percent.</span> </p><p><span m='1135000'>Nonetheless,\
  \ in the 1970s, there was an enormous effort made in</span> <span m='1139000'>trying\
  \ to figure out all of the biology of retroviruses.</span> </p><p><span m='1143000'>And\
  \ by the late 1970s, people concluded this was very</span> <span m='1148000'>interesting\
  \ science. Indeed, proto-oncogenes and</span> <span m='1153000'>oncogenes were discovered,\
  \ but that it was pretty irrelevant to</span> <span m='1158000'>understanding directly\
  \ how human cancer arose, which human cancers</span> <span m='1163000'>could be\
  \ explained rather by somatic mutations in the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='1168000'>In\
  \ 1981, the AIDS infection arose. And, what happened subsequently is</span> <span\
  \ m='1173000'>that there was a race on to try to find out what the infectious agent</span>\
  \ <span m='1177000'>was because it seemed to be an infectious agent.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1181000'>It was being spread from one gay young man to another that was used</span>\
  \ <span m='1185000'>to induce this. And within two years,</span> <span m='1189000'>by\
  \ 1983, the culprit retrovirus had been found. I'm telling you this</span> <span\
  \ m='1193000'>long song and dance to give you the following insight.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1197000'>If there had not been a decade of earlier retrovirus research,</span>\
  \ <span m='1200000'>it could have taken the scientific community many,</span> <span\
  \ m='1204000'>many years to figure out what was causing AIDS. But through</span>\
  \ <span m='1207000'>happenstance, through a sheer stroke of luck, by the time the\
  \ first</span> <span m='1211000'>individuals suffering from AIDS were encountered\
  \ in '81,</span> <span m='1215000'>there was already a backlog of a decade's worth\
  \ of detailed</span> <span m='1218000'>retrovirus research, which made it possible\
  \ to discover,</span> <span m='1222000'>to discern almost within months what was\
  \ causing it.</span> </p><p><span m='1226000'>And, the agent that was causing it\
  \ was a retrovirus.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>The retrovirus here has indicated,\
  \ very schematically, these artists'</span> <span m='1233000'>drawings never have\
  \ any resemblance of what things really look like.</span> </p><p><span m='1237000'>And\
  \ if they do, it's only by coincidence. Let me borrow your</span> <span m='1241000'>laser\
  \ pointer here for a second. So here, and this is what a</span> <span m='1245000'>retrovirus\
  \ looks like just to give you a feeling.</span> </p><p><span m='1248000'>In the\
  \ center, there are two single stranded RNA</span> <span m='1252000'>molecules.\
  \ The virus is diploid. There's two copies of the genome</span> <span m='1256000'>for\
  \ reasons we still don't understand.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>Surrounding\
  \ it is a so-called nucleocapsid, which is responsible</span> <span m='1263000'>for\
  \ protecting the RNA molecules. These two pink dots are</span> <span m='1267000'>reverse-transcriptase\
  \ molecules because as you'll recall,</span> <span m='1270000'>when retroviruses\
  \ infect a cell, they carry the enzyme with them into</span> <span m='1274000'>the\
  \ cell. You could say, why don't they make it after they</span> <span m='1278000'>get\
  \ into the cell? And it's not totally obvious why,</span> <span m='1281000'>but\
  \ this is what they do. There's another shell of proteins out here.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1285000'>And then, beyond that is a lipid bilayer. And this lipid bilayer is,</span>\
  \ <span m='1289000'>as you may recall, stolen from cell from which the</span> <span\
  \ m='1293000'>virus is protruding because if you look at retrovirus-infected cells,</span>\
  \ <span m='1297000'>here's the plasma membrane of a retrovirus-infected cell.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1301000'>Here you can see a nucleo-capsid forming with the RNA\
  \ molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='1305000'>And this shoves its way, protrudes\
  \ its way through the plasma membrane,</span> <span m='1309000'>stealing a patch\
  \ of plasma membrane from the infected cell,</span> <span m='1313000'>and at the\
  \ same time this part of the plasma membrane carries with it</span> <span m='1317000'>viral\
  \ glycoproteins. And viral glycoproteins,</span> <span m='1322000'>they're obviously\
  \ glycosylated, as are many other extracellular</span> <span m='1326000'>proteins.\
  \ And in this case, they're indicated with these yellow</span> <span m='1330000'>ovals,\
  \ and these viral glycoproteins are used to attach to subsequently</span> <span\
  \ m='1334000'>infected cells so what happens is that when the retrovirus gets out\
  \ of</span> <span m='1338000'>the cell, I'll draw it again schematically here,</span>\
  \ <span m='1342000'>it has this glycoproteins coat on it with the plasma membrane,</span>\
  \ <span m='1346000'>and it uses these glycoproteins spikes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1350000'>I just won't put the yellow ovals on them, to attach to cells which\
  \ need</span> <span m='1354000'>to be infected. So, here's a target cell that needs</span>\
  \ <span m='1359000'>to be infected. So, the target cell,</span> <span m='1364000'>and\
  \ how does this virus know how to attach to this cell and not to other</span> <span\
  \ m='1369000'>cells? Because on the surface of the target cell are certain cellular</span>\
  \ <span m='1374000'>proteins, which are used for normal cell physiology,</span>\
  \ <span m='1378000'>which are there, and which the virus has opportunistically developed</span>\
  \ <span m='1383000'>an affinity for. So here on the surface of a target</span> <span\
  \ m='1388000'>cell might be a normal cellular protein to which the viral</span>\
  \ <span m='1393000'>glycoprotein combined. Or, if you want to get technical,</span>\
  \ <span m='1398000'>this enables the virus particle to adsorb, to attach to.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1403000'>Notice the D here rather than the B, to adsorb to the\
  \ surface of the</span> <span m='1408000'>target cell. Importantly, what's the cell\
  \ surface protein of</span> <span m='1413000'>the target cell to which HIV virus\
  \ adsorbs? It's our old friend CD4.</span> </p><p><span m='1418000'>I.e. the HIV\
  \ particle likes to adsorb, preferentially adsorbs to</span> <span m='1422000'>the\
  \ surface of cells that express the CD4 molecule on the surface.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1427000'>Note, by the way, that just five minutes ago, we described a totally</span>\
  \ <span m='1432000'>different function of CD4. CD4 over here was said to represent</span>\
  \ <span m='1437000'>the means by which the T helper cell can recognize MHC molecules\
  \ being</span> <span m='1441000'>displayed on the surface of either of these dendritic</span>\
  \ <span m='1446000'>cells or B cells. But here we see CD4 in a totally</span> <span\
  \ m='1451000'>different context. Here, the CD4 represents the</span> <span m='1456000'>docking\
  \ site to which the viral glycoprotein can attach,</span> <span m='1462000'>enabling\
  \ the virus, which came to be called human immunodeficiency</span> <span m='1467000'>virus.\
  \ In fact, the virus was discovered by</span> <span m='1472000'>two groups simultaneously,\
  \ one of them called HDLV-3, the other</span> <span m='1476000'>called lymphadenopathy\
  \ virus. The first group was American.</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>The second\
  \ group was French, and they allowed Herald Varmus,</span> <span m='1485000'>one\
  \ of the co-discoverers of the proto-oncogene to act as sort of the</span> <span\
  \ m='1490000'>judge to see what it would be called because there was great political</span>\
  \ <span m='1494000'>tension. Would it get the American or the French name depending\
  \ on</span> <span m='1499000'>which of the two warring scientists, and they were\
  \ warring, could claim</span> <span m='1503000'>discovery? So, he had a Solomonic\
  \ decision.</span> </p><p><span m='1508000'>He decided to name it human immunodeficiency\
  \ virus.</span> </p><p><span m='1512000'>That was a compromise. And by the way,\
  \ some people in less than</span> <span m='1516000'>charitable mood say, well, of\
  \ course he named it human</span> <span m='1521000'>immunodeficiency virus because\
  \ those are almost his own initials.</span> </p><p><span m='1525000'>But, I think\
  \ that's unfair. These were his initials.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>Here's\
  \ human immunodeficiency virus. He named it for a perfectly good</span> <span m='1534000'>reason.\
  \ Anyhow, that broke the Franco-American</span> <span m='1538000'>diplomatic tension,\
  \ and now one began to realize that</span> <span m='1542000'>HIV or human immunodeficiency\
  \ virus attacked T helper cells and</span> <span m='1546000'>preferentially infected\
  \ T helper cells by virtue of the ability of</span> <span m='1550000'>the virus\
  \ particle to dock itself to the CD4 molecules presented on the</span> <span m='1554000'>surface\
  \ of these cells. By the way, what happens afterwards,</span> <span m='1558000'>after\
  \ the virus becomes adsorbed to the surface of an infectable cell</span> <span m='1562000'>such\
  \ as a T helper cell. So, here's the virus particle.</span> </p><p><span m='1567000'>Here's\
  \ the surface of a T helper cell. What happens then is these</span> <span m='1573000'>two\
  \ lipid bilayers fuse with one another so that now they became one,</span> <span\
  \ m='1579000'>and now the internal contents, the nucleocapsid which contains the\
  \ RNA</span> <span m='1585000'>and the reverse transcriptase now has direct topological\
  \ access into</span> <span m='1591000'>the cytoplasm of the cell. In fact, the glycoprotein,</span>\
  \ <span m='1596000'>the yellow ovals there of human immunodeficiency virus actually\
  \ had</span> <span m='1600000'>two functions. First, it specifically recognizes</span>\
  \ <span m='1604000'>the CD4 molecules to which it then anchors or adsorbs the virus</span>\
  \ <span m='1608000'>particle. And secondly, it also has fusing functions,</span>\
  \ <span m='1612000'>i.e. it's capable of causing the lipid bilayer of the virion,</span>\
  \ <span m='1616000'>or the virus particle, to fuse with that of the plasma membrane\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1620000'>infected target cell. And, once it's in there,</span>\
  \ <span m='1625000'>then the virus can begin to do its replication. Now,</span>\
  \ <span m='1630000'>the replication of the HIV virus was already pretty well understood\
  \ by</span> <span m='1635000'>the time that HIV was discovered in 1982-'83 because\
  \ of this backlog of</span> <span m='1640000'>retrovirus research. And just to review\
  \ for you how</span> <span m='1645000'>retroviruses replicate, RNA is put into the\
  \ cell,</span> <span m='1650000'>single stranded RNA. It's called plus strand RNA\
  \ because</span> <span m='1655000'>it is of the same polarity of the same strandedness\
  \ as messenger RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1660000'>If it were complementary to\
  \ messenger RNA,</span> <span m='1665000'>then it would be called minus strand RNA.\
  \ This is reverse transcribed by</span> <span m='1671000'>the reverse transcriptase,\
  \ which is carried into the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1676000'>RT stands for\
  \ reverse transcriptase. And now, one gets a double stranded</span> <span m='1681000'>DNA\
  \ molecule, a copy of the virus. And this DNA copy is sometimes</span> <span m='1686000'>called\
  \ a provirus. And just to review,</span> <span m='1691000'>this provirus is then\
  \ subsequently integrated into the chromosomal DNA</span> <span m='1695000'>of the\
  \ cell. So, here's the provirus.</span> </p><p><span m='1700000'>Here's the chromosomal\
  \ DNA. And then, this integrated provirus</span> <span m='1705000'>then serves as\
  \ a template for making progeny plus-stranded RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1710000'>And\
  \ this progeny plus-stranded RNA, which is, by the way, forward</span> <span m='1714000'>transcribed\
  \ by RNA polymerase too, which does the bulk of the heavy</span> <span m='1719000'>lifting\
  \ in terms of making RNA in the nucleus, this plus-stranded RNA</span> <span m='1723000'>can\
  \ have two functions recall. One, it can serve as a template on</span> <span m='1728000'>ribosomes\
  \ for making viral proteins such as the viral capsid proteins.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1733000'>And two, the plus stranded RNA can in turn be encapsidated,</span>\
  \ <span m='1737000'>i.e. it can become packaged. Encapsidate equals,</span> <span\
  \ m='1742000'>it can become packaged by the viral proteins to make progeny virus</span>\
  \ <span m='1746000'>particles, which can then bud, as I've indicated here, from\
  \ the</span> <span m='1750000'>surface of the infected cell. And in fact, we can\
  \ imagine three</span> <span m='1754000'>classes of viral proteins that are required\
  \ for replication.</span> </p><p><span m='1758000'>First is the reverse transcriptase,\
  \ which is encoded by the viral RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1763000'>Second are\
  \ the capsid proteins which carry the RNA,</span> <span m='1767000'>and third are\
  \ the viral glycoproteins up here which these</span> <span m='1771000'>glycoprotein\
  \ spikes which are trans-membrane proteins that</span> <span m='1775000'>protrude\
  \ from the virion, and allow the virion to adsorb to</span> <span m='1779000'>the\
  \ surface of infected cells. It turns out that this virus has</span> <span m='1784000'>become\
  \ an extremely difficult virus to deal with. For most viruses that</span> <span\
  \ m='1789000'>we have encountered over the last 100 years, one has had great success</span>\
  \ <span m='1794000'>in making vaccines against these viruses including,</span> <span\
  \ m='1799000'>as we discussed in great detail, poliovirus.</span> </p><p><span m='1804000'>In\
  \ fact, for smallpox, another virus, the vaccine effort</span> <span m='1809000'>was\
  \ so successful that about 20 years ago, the last case of smallpox</span> <span\
  \ m='1814000'>finally occurred in Eritrea in northeast African when some herdsmen</span>\
  \ <span m='1819000'>had the last documented case. And since that time, there have</span>\
  \ <span m='1824000'>been no documented cases of smallpox in the wild, and there's\
  \ only two or</span> <span m='1829000'>three stocks of smallpox virus surviving.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1834000'>One of them is in some type of research center is Moscow,</span>\
  \ <span m='1837000'>and the other is probably in the Communicable Disease Center\
  \ in</span> <span m='1841000'>Atlanta, Georgia. And, there's been great debate,</span>\
  \ <span m='1844000'>by the way. Should one get rid of those surviving stalks,</span>\
  \ <span m='1848000'>or should one keep them for research? By now, you guys aren't\
  \ vaccinated</span> <span m='1851000'>against smallpox because nobody gets it anymore,\
  \ and there's a certain</span> <span m='1855000'>risk of getting a small pox vaccine.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1859000'>I am, so I'm not worried, but maybe you should be because</span>\
  \ <span m='1862000'>starting about 20-25 years ago, one stopped vaccinating people</span>\
  \ <span m='1866000'>against smallpox because it just doesn't seem to be necessary.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1870000'>Why give them the risk of having some disease which happens\
  \ in one</span> <span m='1874000'>out of a million vaccinees (sic) instead of just\
  \ leaving them</span> <span m='1878000'>unvaccinated? Well, I digress. Back to HIV,</span>\
  \ <span m='1882000'>the fact is we've had enormous lack of success in making a good\
  \ kind of</span> <span m='1886000'>vaccine against HIV, and why is that?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1890000'>Well, one of the critical things is that HIV is attacking\
  \ and</span> <span m='1894000'>replicating in the T helper cells, and the T helper\
  \ cells it turns out</span> <span m='1898000'>are the lynch pains of the immune\
  \ response. Keep in mind that the T</span> <span m='1902000'>helper cells that I've\
  \ shown you in this diagram over here represent</span> <span m='1906000'>these critical\
  \ cellular messengers between the dendritic cells and the</span> <span m='1910000'>macrophages\
  \ on the one hand, and the B cells on the other.</span> </p><p><span m='1914000'>You\
  \ wipe them out, and the ability to make new antibodies is</span> <span m='1918000'>totally\
  \ compromised. It turns out the T helper cells can</span> <span m='1923000'>also\
  \ help to make another class of cells which are called cytotoxic T</span> <span\
  \ m='1929000'>cells, another kind of T cell, cytotoxic, and these cytotoxic T</span>\
  \ <span m='1936000'>cells have on their surfaces T cell receptors, which they can\
  \ use to</span> <span m='1943000'>recognize infected cells, and kill infected cells.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1950000'>So, the cytotoxic T cells aren't involved in making antibody</span>\
  \ <span m='1954000'>responses at all. The cytotoxic T cells are involved</span>\
  \ <span m='1958000'>in recognizing cells that are expressing unusual or foreign</span>\
  \ <span m='1962000'>antigens on their surface, and killing those cells. That's the</span>\
  \ <span m='1966000'>function of the cytotoxic T cells. Obviously, it's quite different</span>\
  \ <span m='1970000'>from the helper T cells. But once again, the activation of</span>\
  \ <span m='1974000'>the cytotoxic T cells, and empowering them to make these</span>\
  \ <span m='1978000'>attacks on abnormal cells depends on the helper T cells.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1982000'>Once again, the helper T cells represent the lynch pins,</span>\
  \ <span m='1986000'>the keystones, of the immune response. But,</span> <span m='1990000'>because\
  \ of this tropism, and when I use the word tropism,</span> <span m='1994000'>I mean\
  \ because of the desire of the virus to phase towards and infect a</span> <span\
  \ m='1999000'>certain subset of cells in the body, this tropism of HIV for infecting</span>\
  \ <span m='2003000'>and killing helper T cells, the production of antibodies is</span>\
  \ <span m='2007000'>strongly compromised on the one hand, and the production of\
  \ cytotoxic T</span> <span m='2011000'>cells is compromised on the other.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2016000'>There's another aspect of HIV infection which is also\
  \ very</span> <span m='2020000'>insidious, and that's the following. It turns out\
  \ that the body can</span> <span m='2025000'>initially make an immune response against\
  \ an infecting HIV particle.</span> </p><p><span m='2030000'>And here's kind of\
  \ what things look like. I hope this shows up here.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>Who\
  \ could lend me a laser pointer again?</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Excellent,\
  \ thank you. OK, so here's what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2045000'>And, there's\
  \ two graphs here. On one hand are the cytotoxic T</span> <span m='2050000'>cells,\
  \ and their level is shown on the solid line here.</span> </p><p><span m='2056000'>So,\
  \ look at the course of infection. It's plotted here in weeks and</span> <span m='2061000'>years.\
  \ If you see what happens in a primary HIV infection,</span> <span m='2066000'>and\
  \ here on the right on this ordinate here is the viral titer</span> <span m='2072000'>indicated\
  \ on a log scale. So, this is a semi-log graph for the</span> <span m='2077000'>viral\
  \ titer. And what you see over here is that when you initially</span> <span m='2081000'>infected\
  \ it, there's an enormous burst of viral titer.</span> </p><p><span m='2085000'>It\
  \ goes up by four or five orders of magnitude, and then it falls down</span> <span\
  \ m='2089000'>dramatically by two or three orders of magnitude. And it goes on,</span>\
  \ <span m='2093000'>and it remains depressed by two or three orders of magnitude\
  \ below its</span> <span m='2097000'>initial height for a number of years.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2102000'>What's going on then? The immune system has come to grips</span>\
  \ <span m='2106000'>with the presence of the HIV virus, and begins successfully\
  \ to try to</span> <span m='2110000'>eliminate it. How does the immune system eliminate\
  \ HIV?</span> </p><p><span m='2114000'>By two mechanisms. First of all, the immune\
  \ system makes neutralizing</span> <span m='2118000'>antibodies of the sort that\
  \ float through the serum,</span> <span m='2122000'>and are able to glom onto the\
  \ virus particle, attach to the virus</span> <span m='2126000'>particle, and thereby\
  \ prevent it from being infectious.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>And secondly,\
  \ as I mentioned last time, the immune system also can</span> <span m='2134000'>recognize\
  \ virus-infected cells and kill them. And by killing a</span> <span m='2138000'>virus-infected\
  \ cell, the immune system prevents that cell</span> <span m='2142000'>from continuing\
  \ to function as a factory for putting out new virus</span> <span m='2146000'>particles.\
  \ So, there's two ways by which virus</span> <span m='2150000'>particles are eliminated,\
  \ but note here that the virus</span> <span m='2154000'>infected cell which is critically\
  \ important among all the cell types</span> <span m='2158000'>in the body are the\
  \ T helper cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>So, certain components of the\
  \ immune system are killing the T helper</span> <span m='2166000'>cells that are\
  \ involved in harboring and producing HIV virus.</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>So,\
  \ there's an auto destruction on the part of the immune system.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2174000'>Look, at the same time, at the titer, at the number of CD4 cells,</span>\
  \ <span m='2179000'>and they're indicated here on the left ordinate,</span> <span\
  \ m='2183000'>in this case, cells per microliter. CD4 cells originally started up</span>\
  \ <span m='2187000'>here. They go down by a factor of two or</span> <span m='2192000'>three\
  \ for the first weeks, and then over a period of years</span> <span m='2196000'>there's\
  \ this ongoing struggle between the HIV particle and the</span> <span m='2200000'>immune\
  \ system as the number of CD4 cells, and the CD4 cells we've said</span> <span m='2204000'>before,\
  \ the CD4 positive cells are these T helper cells as the number</span> <span m='2208000'>of\
  \ these cells per microliter of blood progressively declines further</span> <span\
  \ m='2212000'>and further and further. And finally, the number of CD4</span> <span\
  \ m='2216000'>positive cells, i.e. T helper cells,</span> <span m='2220000'>gets\
  \ so low that the body is totally overwhelmed, and the patient then</span> <span\
  \ m='2224000'>dies of an opportunistic infection.</span> </p><p><span m='2228000'>What\
  \ do I mean by an opportunistic infection? Well,</span> <span m='2232000'>what I\
  \ mean is that we are surrounded all the time by all kinds</span> <span m='2236000'>of\
  \ microbes, which given the chance will kill us within a couple days.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2241000'>Keep in mind, I told you that there are in your gut,</span> <span\
  \ m='2245000'>as many bacterial cells as there are the rest of your body.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2250000'>And some of these bacteria are really nasty. I remember,</span>\
  \ <span m='2253000'>my grandfather got kicked in the belly by a horse,</span> <span\
  \ m='2256000'>and three days later he was dead. Why? Because some of the bacteria</span>\
  \ <span m='2260000'>got out of his gut, got into his peritoneal fluid cavity,</span>\
  \ <span m='2263000'>and gone. This was the pre-antibiotic era,</span> <span m='2267000'>by\
  \ the way, never new him very well because he died in 1916.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2270000'>I'm just telling you that your gut is full of all kinds of nasty thing</span>\
  \ <span m='2274000'>on your skin. Not just on my skin, but on your skin there are\
  \ billions</span> <span m='2277000'>of staph aureus bacteria. They're just waiting\
  \ to cause you</span> <span m='2281000'>problems. Don't look. It's OK.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2285000'>Don't look too closely. They're just waiting to cause a</span> <span\
  \ m='2289000'>nasty infection as well. Everyday we breathe in all kinds of</span>\
  \ <span m='2293000'>awful microbes, fungi, and all these kinds of things</span>\
  \ <span m='2297000'>including pneumocystis. And, rarely do we get sick because</span>\
  \ <span m='2301000'>of the extraordinary competence of the immune system to respond\
  \ to such</span> <span m='2305000'>a diversity of infectious agents, and to hold\
  \ them at bay.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>In the 20th century, the percentage\
  \ of people who die of</span> <span m='2314000'>infectious diseases has plummeted\
  \ both because of the immune system</span> <span m='2318000'>and because we're eating\
  \ healthier up to a point,</span> <span m='2322000'>and because of antibiotics and\
  \ antifungals. But if the immune</span> <span m='2326000'>system is defective, all\
  \ the antibiotics in the world,</span> <span m='2330000'>and all the antifungal\
  \ agents can't save a patient if their CD4 cells</span> <span m='2334000'>get down\
  \ very, very low because these antifungals</span> <span m='2338000'>always worked\
  \ as collaborators with the immune system.</span> </p><p><span m='2343000'>They\
  \ get rid of a bulk of the infection, but the immune system has</span> <span m='2347000'>to\
  \ wipe out the residue. And what you see here is a struggle</span> <span m='2351000'>going\
  \ on for a period of three, four, five, six years where the</span> <span m='2355000'>viral\
  \ titer is successfully held low, and then all of a sudden as the</span> <span m='2359000'>immune\
  \ system weakens the viral titer goes up to high levels,</span> <span m='2363000'>wipes\
  \ out the residual T helper cells, and death invariably</span> <span m='2367000'>ensues.\
  \ Now, I've given you one reason why</span> <span m='2371000'>the immune system\
  \ can't deal with this virus, because virtually all</span> <span m='2374000'>other\
  \ viruses attack various tissues throughout our body,</span> <span m='2378000'>but\
  \ they don't attack the immune system itself.</span> </p><p><span m='2381000'>Here,\
  \ we're having a virus which is attacking the defense of the body,</span> <span\
  \ m='2384000'>that is to say, the immune system. So, one reason is the continuing</span>\
  \ <span m='2388000'>depletion of the T helper cells. They can regenerate themselves\
  \ for</span> <span m='2391000'>a period of time, very impressively long period of</span>\
  \ <span m='2394000'>time, four, five, six, seven years. But ultimately,</span> <span\
  \ m='2398000'>they get worn out, they die. Another reason is this is antigenic</span>\
  \ <span m='2402000'>variation. Now, if you look at the retrovirus</span> <span m='2408000'>particle,\
  \ what you see is on the surface the glycoprotein.</span> </p><p><span m='2414000'>It's\
  \ right here. And, the glycoprotein is used by antibodies</span> <span m='2419000'>to\
  \ recognize and bind to the virus particle and neutralize it,</span> <span m='2425000'>same\
  \ as with poliovirus. But let's imagine,</span> <span m='2430000'>as happens to\
  \ be the case, that the virus is highly error prone</span> <span m='2434000'>in\
  \ replicating its genome. When I say error prone, I mean that</span> <span m='2439000'>instead\
  \ of the host cell, polymerase, which makes ultimately</span> <span m='2444000'>one\
  \ mistake out of a billion, the viral replication machinery</span> <span m='2448000'>makes\
  \ mistakes all the time. It's quite defective in the</span> <span m='2453000'>fidelity\
  \ and the faithfulness with which it replicates nucleic acid.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2458000'>That means that after each cycle of replication, there are in effect</span>\
  \ <span m='2462000'>mutant viruses that have been produced, mutant progeny viruses,</span>\
  \ <span m='2467000'>and where the mutation rate instead of being one in 10-9 might\
  \ be one in</span> <span m='2471000'>10-2 or one in 10-3. And that means that there\
  \ are</span> <span m='2476000'>continually novel variants of HIV being produced\
  \ in a person's body.</span> </p><p><span m='2480000'>Let's imagine that that person\
  \ has developed antibodies against the</span> <span m='2485000'>viral glycoprotein\
  \ of the virus that initially infected him or her.</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>Let's\
  \ imagine that. And those antibodies are successful</span> <span m='2494000'>in\
  \ eliminating most of the virus particles of the sort that initially</span> <span\
  \ m='2498000'>infected that individual. But now we can imagine the</span> <span\
  \ m='2502000'>possibility that in the imperative weeks or months,</span> <span m='2506000'>a\
  \ new strain of HIV will arise within that individual's body a</span> <span m='2510000'>mutant\
  \ strain in which the sequences that code the viral glycoprotein had</span> <span\
  \ m='2514000'>been changed slightly. And now, the viral glycoprotein has</span>\
  \ <span m='2518000'>changed slightly its epitopes. And the initially developed</span>\
  \ <span m='2522000'>neutralizing antibody that recognized the initial cohort of</span>\
  \ <span m='2527000'>virus coming into the cell in the individual no longer works\
  \ because</span> <span m='2532000'>the virus has undertaken a strategy of immune\
  \ evasion,</span> <span m='2537000'>sometimes it's called immunoevasion, in which\
  \ now the viral glycoprotein,</span> <span m='2542000'>although it's still competent\
  \ to affect a replication cycle to adsorb</span> <span m='2547000'>and fuse to the\
  \ surface of an affected cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2552000'>Many of the epitopes,\
  \ many of the oligopeptide antigens on</span> <span m='2556000'>the surface of the\
  \ glycoprotein have been changed slightly through amino</span> <span m='2560000'>acid\
  \ substitutions, through point mutations.</span> </p><p><span m='2564000'>And hence,\
  \ the initially developed antibody, which previously was</span> <span m='2568000'>successful\
  \ in glomming on and neutralizing this virus particle is</span> <span m='2572000'>rendered\
  \ ineffective. And now, this second wave,</span> <span m='2576000'>this new strain\
  \ of HIV will grow up and expand in that individual,</span> <span m='2580000'>and\
  \ once again provoke a new immune response.</span> </p><p><span m='2584000'>And,\
  \ the same cycle will repeat it. The second strain will now soon be</span> <span\
  \ m='2587000'>eliminated, but while the elimination is going on,</span> <span m='2591000'>there's\
  \ strong Darwinian selective pressure favoring the outgrowth of</span> <span m='2595000'>yet\
  \ another mutant strain which is not recognized by either of the two</span> <span\
  \ m='2599000'>initial antibody responses. And so, over this period of many</span>\
  \ <span m='2603000'>years, what's happening is that the virus in the immune system\
  \ are</span> <span m='2607000'>playing continual cat and mouse games with one another.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2611000'>The immune system goes after the virus; the virus moves\
  \ over here;</span> <span m='2614000'>the immune system goes after that; and so\
  \ you have a succession of</span> <span m='2618000'>antigenic variance. Here's one\
  \ variant.</span> </p><p><span m='2622000'>Here's another variant. Here's another\
  \ variant, and so</span> <span m='2625000'>forth. By the time the immune system\
  \ succeeds in getting rid of</span> <span m='2629000'>the first variant, a new variant\
  \ has appeared,</span> <span m='2633000'>and then the immune system ramps up its\
  \ defenses and tries to get rid of</span> <span m='2637000'>that. And, it succeeds\
  \ almost. But by the time that has happened,</span> <span m='2640000'>yet a third\
  \ variant has appeared. And so, there are these continual</span> <span m='2644000'>clonal\
  \ successions. A clonal succession represents a</span> <span m='2648000'>time where\
  \ one clonal virus explodes, expands. It's soon eliminated,</span> <span m='2651000'>collapses,\
  \ and then another clone comes up and expands.</span> </p><p><span m='2655000'>And\
  \ this goes on. This works OK for about four,</span> <span m='2659000'>five, six\
  \ years. But ultimately, the ability of the</span> <span m='2662000'>T helper cells\
  \ to replenish themselves and to continue to mount</span> <span m='2666000'>an effective\
  \ immune response fails.</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>There's yet another aspect\
  \ of HIV infection which is so insidious,</span> <span m='2674000'>and that's the\
  \ following. Let's look at the viral life cycle right</span> <span m='2678000'>here,\
  \ and the provirus, remember the provirus is this thing</span> <span m='2682000'>right\
  \ here, which is integrated into the chromosomal DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2686000'>And,\
  \ we can assume that this provirus is transcribed by RNA</span> <span m='2690000'>polymerase\
  \ too, and I will tell you that the</span> <span m='2694000'>promoter of the provirus\
  \ is carried in by the proviral DNA,</span> <span m='2698000'>and actually depends\
  \ on transcription factors that are</span> <span m='2702000'>present in the T helper\
  \ cell. In fact, you'll recall that the T</span> <span m='2707000'>helper cell gets\
  \ excited sometimes, and other times it's not excited.</span> </p><p><span m='2711000'>And\
  \ she gets excited if I can attach gender to a T helper cell,</span> <span m='2715000'>when\
  \ she encounters macrophages and dendritic cells,</span> <span m='2720000'>and/or\
  \ when she encounters B cells. Other times, the T helper cell is</span> <span m='2724000'>kind\
  \ of quiet and unactivated (sic). And, what happens when a T helper</span> <span\
  \ m='2728000'>cell gets activated through these encounters?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2733000'>The T helper cell starts making her own transcription factors,</span>\
  \ <span m='2737000'>which are used in order to facilitate these complex biological</span>\
  \ <span m='2741000'>interactions with both antigen-presenting cells,</span> <span\
  \ m='2745000'>macrophages and dendritic cells, and later on, B cells. And those</span>\
  \ <span m='2749000'>same transcription factors that the T helper cell uses to turn\
  \ on its</span> <span m='2753000'>own expression program are used by the provirus\
  \ to transcribe</span> <span m='2757000'>its own DNA, i.e. HIV has evolved a proviral</span>\
  \ <span m='2761000'>promoter sequence here which takes advantage of transcription\
  \ factors</span> <span m='2765000'>that are present uniquely in an activated T cell.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2769000'>And when those transcription factors are available,</span>\
  \ <span m='2773000'>not only does the T cell become activated, but the provirus\
  \ becomes</span> <span m='2777000'>transcribed because these transcription factors\
  \ now enable RNA</span> <span m='2781000'>polymerase 2 of the host to transcribe\
  \ the provirus.</span> </p><p><span m='2785000'>But let's imagine now, if we follow\
  \ that scenario to its conclusion,</span> <span m='2789000'>what happens when the\
  \ T cell is not activated?</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>When the T cell is quiescent,\
  \ when it's quiet, these transcription</span> <span m='2797000'>factors are unavailable\
  \ to attach to the promoter of the integrated</span> <span m='2801000'>provirus,\
  \ and as a consequence the provirus will not be transcribed.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2805000'>It won't make RNA, and in that situation, how will anybody know</span>\
  \ <span m='2809000'>that there's an integrated provirus in there? Well,</span> <span\
  \ m='2813000'>the provirus is not being transcribed. The transcripts aren't</span>\
  \ <span m='2817000'>being used to make viral protein. So in effect, the only evidence\
  \ for</span> <span m='2822000'>the existence of HIV in the cell is this segment\
  \ of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2826000'>In other words, this provirus can hide\
  \ out in an unactivated quiescent</span> <span m='2830000'>T cell indefinitely.\
  \ And, the immune system can't know</span> <span m='2834000'>that there's a provirus\
  \ hiding out in this T helper cell because it's</span> <span m='2838000'>not being\
  \ transcribed. And therefore, one can have a</span> <span m='2842000'>quiescent\
  \ T helper cell, and several other cell types in the</span> <span m='2846000'>body,\
  \ macrophages also, which aren't transcribing their</span> <span m='2850000'>proviruses.\
  \ Well, you'll say,</span> <span m='2854000'>so what? It doesn't make any difference.\
  \ If it's not being</span> <span m='2858000'>transcribed, it's not going to hurt\
  \ the individual.</span> </p><p><span m='2862000'>But, keep in mind that the idea\
  \ of getting rid of a viral infection is</span> <span m='2866000'>to eliminate all\
  \ traces of a viral genome from an infected individual,</span> <span m='2869000'>and\
  \ that's what happens with smallpox and with poliovirus,</span> <span m='2873000'>and\
  \ with measles and virtually all the other infections we have.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2877000'>But here, we have a situation where the viral genome can hide out\
  \ in a</span> <span m='2881000'>latent or inapparent (sic) configuration.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2885000'>There's no way to know it's there, and it may reemerge\
  \ days, weeks,</span> <span m='2889000'>months, even years later because this previously\
  \ transcriptionally</span> <span m='2893000'>silent provirus may suddenly be present\
  \ in a cell which suddenly</span> <span m='2897000'>becomes activated. And now,\
  \ an individual who</span> <span m='2902000'>\"thought\" quote unquote that he or\
  \ she had gotten rid of HIV infection</span> <span m='2906000'>all of a sudden realizes\
  \ there are viral genomes still hiding</span> <span m='2910000'>out in the body.\
  \ And what that means is that in</span> <span m='2914000'>effect, it's absolutely\
  \ impossible to rid the body of HIV infection</span> <span m='2918000'>ever. Once\
  \ an individual is infected, in fact,</span> <span m='2922000'>that individual is\
  \ infected for life. There's no way on Earth what we</span> <span m='2926000'>have\
  \ at present of getting rid of the viral infection because the</span> <span m='2930000'>viral\
  \ genome is always hiding out here or there in different</span> <span m='2934000'>interstices\
  \ of the immune system, hiding out in transcriptionally</span> <span m='2938000'>silent\
  \ state. Of course, we have very effective</span> <span m='2942000'>drugs against\
  \ HIV now. Some drugs inhibit the reverse</span> <span m='2946000'>transcriptase.\
