title: 'Lecture 8: Genetics 3'
transcript: <p><span m='5000'>Let's dive in today and look at</span> <span m='9000'>how
  geneticists use genetics. I've told you up until now about</span> <span m='13000'>some
  of the history of genetics and how it gave rise to our</span> <span m='17000'>understandings
  about genetic transmission in traits, about</span> <span m='21000'>genetic mapping,
  linkage analysis,</span> <span m='24000'>how all this helped confirm the Chromosomes
  Theory.</span> </p><p><span m='27000'>And we wove in a number of concepts about
  how scientific theories are</span> <span m='31000'>developed and data is interpreted
  and intuitions are made,</span> <span m='35000'>and then how they're actually proven,
  what sort of evidence it takes to</span> <span m='39000'>actually achieve conscientious
  around theories.</span> </p><p><span m='43000'>And that often takes sometimes years,
  many times decades before</span> <span m='47000'>full contentious is achieved around
  things. Today I want to turn a</span> <span m='51000'>little bit to the experimental
  uses of genetics in a more day-to-day</span> <span m='55000'>fashion. And you will
  recall this coat of arms that I put up here.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>Function.
  Gene. Protein. Biochemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='65000'>Genetics. And I told
  you about how these were two different ways to</span> <span m='70000'>study biological
  function. Today I want to talk a little bit</span> <span m='75000'>about how we
  use genetics to study biological function.</span> </p><p><span m='80000'>And, in
  particular, I'm going to pick some examples of how we use</span> <span m='85000'>genetics
  to study biological function that have to do with the</span> <span m='90000'>biological
  functions of biochemistry.</span> </p><p><span m='95000'>So already we're beginning
  to look ahead to this connection between</span> <span m='100000'>gene and protein,
  which molecular biology will</span> <span m='106000'>establish for us. So, suppose
  you want to do genetics.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>You've got to study some
  organism. We talked already about Mendel's</span> <span m='117000'>choice of organism,
  the pea. We talked about some of its</span> <span m='121000'>advantages and disadvantages.
  Advantages you could get pure</span> <span m='125000'>breeding strains in the market,
  you could, when you're done with the</span> <span m='128000'>experiments, feed it
  to the other monks. There were a lot of things</span> <span m='132000'>like that,
  that were advantageous about the pea,</span> <span m='136000'>but it had problems
  of generation time. You would only get,</span> <span m='139000'>certainly in Europe,
  a generation or so a year. In Northern Europe maybe</span> <span m='143000'>you
  could squeeze a second generation in not so good.</span> </p><p><span m='147000'>Fruit
  flies, a very attractive system in many respects because you</span> <span m='150000'>could
  grow many, much larger numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='153000'>The generation time
  is on the order of two weeks or so to go from a</span> <span m='156000'>fertilized
  fly embryo, a fly egg developing into a fly,</span> <span m='160000'>developing
  into a mature adult, able itself to have offspring.</span> </p><p><span m='163000'>So,
  very attractive. There are other systems that people studied.</span> </p><p><span
  m='166000'>And, of course, one of the reasons they study this system is because</span>
  <span m='170000'>it's interesting, I'm sorry, because it's tractable.</span> </p><p><span
  m='173000'>And the other reason is because it's interesting.</span> </p><p><span
  m='176000'>So, tractability is very important to a geneticist, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='180000'>The number of whale geneticists is few, for the most part.</span> </p><p><span
  m='183000'>But we also want to choose our system because of what it will tell</span>
  <span m='187000'>us about the system we want to study. Like if you want to study</span>
  <span m='191000'>distinctive things about the immune system, you might want to study
  them</span> <span m='195000'>in mice, or if you could even study them in people,</span>
  <span m='198000'>although you can't set up crosses in people. We'll come to that
  on</span> <span m='202000'>Monday. If you wanted to study things about basic aspects
  of</span> <span m='206000'>development, you might study them in fruit flies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='210000'>And if you wanted to study basic biochemistry, the place
  to study</span> <span m='214000'>basic biochemistry might best be done in single-celled
  organisms,</span> <span m='218000'>which also have to carry out biochemical pathways
  like glycolysis</span> <span m='222000'>and synthesis of amino acids and things
  like that.</span> </p><p><span m='226000'>They're going to be, by far, the most
  tractable systems.</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>And so, people are particularly
  fond for doing things like studying</span> <span m='234000'>basic biochemistry and
  many other aspects of basic molecular biology</span> <span m='238000'>to studying
  the organism yeast. Yeast is a friend of human beings.</span> </p><p><span m='242000'>Certainly,
  yeast has been an intensely studied organism because</span> <span m='246000'>of
  its practical benefits in the making of bread,</span> <span m='251000'>in the making
  of beer. So, fermentation processes,</span> <span m='256000'>dough rising and all
  that. But yeast also is a tremendously</span> <span m='260000'>important organism
  for the geneticist. It is an extremely</span> <span m='265000'>elegant experimental
  system. Yeast is a fungus.</span> </p><p><span m='270000'>It is a single-celled
  eukaryote. That is true nucleus. It's got</span> <span m='275000'>chromosomes that
  pair up. It's cells, through a first order</span> <span m='280000'>approximation,
  that are an awful lot like your</span> <span m='285000'>cells in terms of having
  all of the basic important eukaryotic</span> <span m='291000'>organelles in the
  nucleus, mitochondria, other things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='296000'>So,
  yeast is a great model for many</span> <span m='301000'>purposes. And we're not
  going to talk much about the cell biology of</span> <span m='306000'>yeast, but
  I do want to talk about the husbandry of yeast,</span> <span m='310000'>how it is
  that you grow yeast. So, the way a geneticists grows</span> <span m='315000'>yeast
  is take growth medium that has lots of rich nutrients.</span> </p><p><span m='320000'>You
  could take a broth with lots of amino acids and all sorts of stuff,</span> <span
  m='325000'>you know, a little bit of salt, lots of water of course.</span> </p><p><span
  m='330000'>And if you take a single yeast cell and it's got lots and lots of rich</span>
  <span m='335000'>nutrients in this broth here, you put your yeast cell into the</span>
  <span m='340000'>broth, so I will do that. Here's my flask, here's my little</span>
  <span m='345000'>rod which has a yeast cell or a couple of yeast cells on the end
  of</span> <span m='350000'>it. I put it in there and I grow it at an appropriate
  temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='355000'>Let's say 30 degrees, for example, would
  be a nice temperature.</span> </p><p><span m='360000'>I could do that if I wanted
  to. Then a C obviously. I grow it up</span> <span m='365000'>and I get a culture
  of yeast in there. And I can tell because this</span> <span m='370000'>nice clear
  broth is now all cloudy with yeast that's grown up in it.</span> </p><p><span m='375000'>Now
  I want to study these guys, so what I do is I pour them out onto a</span> <span
  m='380000'>Petri plate. The Petri plate has on it a medium, a solid medium,</span>
  <span m='385000'>an agar medium that again has nutrients.</span> </p><p><span m='390000'>And
  if I pour this out, and I pour out a lot of it,</span> <span m='394000'>what will
  happen? Well, there will be yeast all over the place and it</span> <span m='399000'>will
  be very smootsie. There will be like yeast cells</span> <span m='403000'>everywhere
  and it's not very organized. So,</span> <span m='408000'>what I want to do is I
  want to take that and I want to dilute it.</span> </p><p><span m='413000'>I want
  to take only a little bit of the broth and put a little bit of</span> <span m='417000'>the
  broth on my plate. Maybe I'll have diluted it first.</span> </p><p><span m='422000'>And
  then I want to spread it around with a little spreader,</span> <span m='428000'>here's
  a little glass spreader maybe or something, and push it back and</span> <span m='433000'>forth,
  so that really there are just individual single cells scattered</span> <span m='439000'>randomly,
  scattered around. And so, then this cell begins to</span> <span m='444000'>grow
  and divide and divide and divide and I get a colony.</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>A
  little hill of cells all of which descend from a single cell that was</span> <span
  m='454000'>put into that position. And the reason I know that they all</span> <span
  m='459000'>descend from a single cell is because most of this plate does not</span>
  <span m='463000'>have cells on it. Most of the plate is sparse.</span> </p><p><span
  m='468000'>I've just got cells, cells, cells, cells scattered about. And because</span>
  <span m='473000'>of that I know that these had of been individual events.</span>
  </p><p><span m='477000'>These things are called colonies. Now, when yeast grows
  and divides</span> <span m='483000'>like that, let's take a moment and talk about
  its life cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='490000'>We'll introduce its life cycle here.
  Yeast proper eukaryote,</span> <span m='497000'>so it has a diploid stage. It grows
  as a diploid. And it can</span> <span m='504000'>undergo mitosis in which all of
  the chromosomes line up, as</span> <span m='511000'>we talked about. They've already
  pre-replicated so</span> <span m='518000'>that they'll be ready to divide up and
  give one to each daughter cell,</span> <span m='524000'>and there you go. N for
  yeast is 16. Yeast happens to have 16 pairs of</span> <span m='530000'>chromosomes.
  Peas had seven. Humans have 23 pairs. Every</span> <span m='536000'>organism has
  its own yeast of 16. Now, what we do is we undergo</span> <span m='542000'>meiosis
  to make haploid cells, sperm or eggs in the human</span> <span m='547000'>population.
  Yeast also undergoes meiosis to make spores.</span> </p><p><span m='552000'>It sporulates
  and it produces spores. And it turns out these</span> <span m='557000'>spores, of
  course as you would expect, have N chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='562000'>They
  undergo meiosis just as we drew it on the board.</span> </p><p><span m='567000'>And
  these can come in two flavors. They happen to come not in male and</span> <span
  m='572000'>females, but A and alpha, there you go. A and alpha cells can</span>
  <span m='577000'>mate together to produce, again, a diploid. They fertilize</span>
  <span m='582000'>and can produce a diploid. They fuse to do that. And you now</span>
  <span m='587000'>get back to a diploid from your haploid. So, this looks just</span>
  <span m='592000'>identical to the human genetic cycle here, but there is one difference.</span>
  </p><p><span m='597000'>What's the difference? Sorry? Time. Yes,</span> <span m='602000'>it's
  true. Yeast can divide much more rapidly. Yeast can have</span> <span m='607000'>offspring
  extremely rapidly over a course of a day or so.</span> </p><p><span m='612000'>And
  humans take somewhat longer than that. They,</span> <span m='617000'>for example,
  have to wait until they get out of college to be able to</span> <span m='623000'>reproduce
  mostly. What else? There's one other</span> <span m='628000'>important thing. It
  turns out that yeast can also</span> <span m='633000'>undergo mitosis as a haploid.
  In other words,</span> <span m='638000'>the haploid cells of yeast, when it makes
  individual haploids,</span> <span m='643000'>they can continue to grow indefinitely.
  By contrast,</span> <span m='649000'>your gametes cannot. You do not have an independent
  human stage in</span> <span m='654000'>which you are haploid, or your gametes are
  haploid.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Whereas, yeast can hang out as a haploid
  for a very long time until</span> <span m='663000'>it decides it wants to mate.
  This is very convenient for</span> <span m='666000'>geneticists. Geneticists like
  this because it means we can grow the</span> <span m='669000'>thing as a diploid,
  we can grow the thing as a haploid.</span> </p><p><span m='672000'>When we want
  to mate them, we can mate them together,</span> <span m='675000'>but we can also
  study them alone. And, you could imagine, this is</span> <span m='678000'>going
  to be really good for studying recessive traits,</span> <span m='681000'>right?
  So, that's one of the reasons why geneticists are fond of</span> <span m='684000'>yeast.
  There are many reasons geneticists are fond of yeast.</span> </p><p><span m='687000'>Just
  growing yeast, it smells very nice in the lab.</span> </p><p><span m='690000'>For
  example, try growing E. coli by comparison. So, now,</span> <span m='700000'>it
  turns out that yeast is very happy if you grow it on rich medium.</span> </p><p><span
  m='710000'>But yeast can grow on minimal media with very few macro molecules.</span>
  </p><p><span m='720000'>It needs a carbon source which is some sugar that it can
  ferment.</span> </p><p><span m='728000'>It needs a nitrogen. It needs some simple
  source of nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='737000'>It needs some simple source of
  nitrogen. It needs a source of</span> <span m='745000'>phosphorus. It needs some
  other trace salts and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='754000'>And obviously
  it needs some water. That's it. If you think about</span> <span m='758000'>what's
  in a yeast cell, like it's got phospholipid bilayers.</span> </p><p><span m='763000'>But
  you're not giving it any phospholipids.</span> </p><p><span m='768000'>Why is it
  able to grow? It makes them. What about proteins?</span> </p><p><span m='772000'>They're
  made up of 20 amino acids. You're not giving it any amino</span> <span m='777000'>acids.
  Why? It makes them. Yeast is extraordinarily</span> <span m='781000'>self-reliant.
  You, by contrast, are not as self-reliant.</span> </p><p><span m='785000'>There
  are a number of amino acids which, if I don't give you,</span> <span m='788000'>you
  can't live because you don't actually have the ability to make</span> <span m='792000'>those
  amino acids. But yeast is able to make the vast</span> <span m='795000'>majority
  of things. Basically, you almost just needed</span> <span m='799000'>to give it
  the elements. As for carbon sources and things</span> <span m='802000'>like that,
  it's very happy with a wide variety of fermentable sugars.</span> </p><p><span m='806000'>You
  can give it glucose. You can give it sucrose.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>You
  can give it galactose. You can give it fructose and it</span> <span m='814000'>will
  deal. So, yeast is very well set up</span> <span m='818000'>metabolically. So, it's
  got all of these pathways</span> <span m='822000'>of the sort Bob has talked about
  for being able to breakdown the things</span> <span m='826000'>you give it and being
  able to synthesize up the things it needs.</span> </p><p><span m='830000'>Now, yeast,
  of course, is not stupid. Because if you give it</span> <span m='834000'>amino acids
  it will use it. If you give it all sorts of other</span> <span m='838000'>things
  it will use it. So, yeast is able to use rich media</span> <span m='844000'>that
  have lots of complex nutrients and macromolecules.</span> </p><p><span m='854000'>So,
  it has an ability, it has everything it needs to make</span> <span m='863000'>these
  things, but it has an ability to regulate that.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>So,
  the processes, the enzymatic pathways that produce</span> <span m='877000'>complex
  macromolecules, amino acids, phospholipids,</span> <span m='881000'>et cetera, will
  be down regulated, shut off, or at least decreased if</span> <span m='885000'>you
  provide it with these macromolecules.</span> </p><p><span m='889000'>That's an interesting
  question of how it manages to regulate its</span> <span m='893000'>biochemistry.
  Why does it care? Why doesn't it, why not just have</span> <span m='897000'>those
  pathways be on all the time? Sorry? Waste of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='901000'>It
  needs ATP. It costs money. So, at the beginning probably they</span> <span m='904000'>were
  on all the time, but some yeast evolves,</span> <span m='906000'>or some precursor
  to yeast evolves that's able to regulate it.</span> </p><p><span m='909000'>That
  one is able to be more frugal with its energy.</span> </p><p><span m='912000'>It
  outgrows its other ones and then another, dah, dah,</span> <span m='914000'>dah.
  Any place you can make a few ATPs here or there,</span> <span m='917000'>eventually
  the organism that does it will out compete the organism that</span> <span m='920000'>doesn't.
  And so, rather fine control of this,</span> <span m='923000'>which is a topic we'll
  come to in a couple of days,</span> <span m='925000'>gene regulation and other kinds
  of pathway regulation is</span> <span m='928000'>very important. OK. So, we want
  to know how does it</span> <span m='933000'>do it? What are the enzymes? What are
  the pathways? How does it</span> <span m='939000'>actually make, oh, I don't know,</span>
  <span m='946000'>arginine? How does it make arginine, amino acid? How would you
  find out</span> <span m='953000'>how yeast makes arginine? How can yeast synthesize
  arginines?</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>So, you remember our picture that the
  biochemist wants to study a</span> <span m='963000'>problem by grinding up the cell
  and purifying a component able to do</span> <span m='967000'>something. So, a biochemist
  might want to grind up</span> <span m='970000'>the cell and purify an enzyme that
  can make arginine.</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>Form what, of course, is an interesting
  question?</span> </p><p><span m='977000'>And then the thing that made the thing
  that was used to substrate,</span> <span m='981000'>et cetera, et cetera. What would
  a geneticist do?</span> </p><p><span m='984000'>How does a geneticist approach the
  problem with how does</span> <span m='988000'>yeast make arginine? Find a yeast
  that cannot make it,</span> <span m='993000'>that's what we do. That is. So, what
  we need is a mutant.</span> </p><p><span m='999000'>A geneticist wants a yeast that
  cannot make it.</span> </p><p><span m='1006000'>A geneticist wants mutants. How
  do you find the mutant? You</span> <span m='1013000'>find the mutant by going on
  a mutant hunt.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>That is what geneticists refer to
  it as. And it's a very exciting thing.</span> </p><p><span m='1024000'>You go off,
  load up the guns and go off into the bush on a mutant hunt.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1028000'>And so, I want to talk about the strategy for a mutant hunt.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1032000'>How do we look for a yeast that can't make arginine?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1036000'>Sorry? Cannot. I've got a yeast that can make arginine,</span>
  <span m='1040000'>because normal wild type yeast can grow on minimal media without</span>
  <span m='1044000'>arginine supplied. And, when I examine it,</span> <span m='1048000'>it's
  got arginine in it. Yes? So, who should I find?</span> </p><p><span m='1052000'>Proteins
  that contain arginine and then it doesn't have the proteins</span> <span m='1057000'>that
  doesn't have arginine. Interesting. Now, the problem is</span> <span m='1062000'>almost
  all proteins will have an arginine, or the vast majority of</span> <span m='1067000'>them.
  And a yeast that lacked all those proteins that didn't have</span> <span m='1072000'>arginine
  would not be much of a yeast. I think it would</span> <span m='1077000'>be pretty
  dead. So, it's a good thought if it was a</span> <span m='1082000'>more dispensable
  function. But that's going to be tough.</span> </p><p><span m='1086000'>Or, maybe
  I can use the fact that it's dead. Now in a sense,</span> <span m='1091000'>can
  I find the yeast? Yes? You had a thought on this.</span> </p><p><span m='1096000'>Yes?
  Kill all yeast that make arginine, excellent.</span> </p><p><span m='1100000'>So,
  if I had a chemical agent that could kill yeast that can make</span> <span m='1105000'>arginine,
  I could only get the yeast that make it. How would I do that?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1110000'>That's a very interesting idea. You're right. You could construct</span>
  <span m='1114000'>the chemical molecule in the arginine pathway which when it was</span>
  <span m='1118000'>broken down enzymatically made some toxic product,</span> <span
  m='1122000'>and only those yeasts that couldn't break it down would be able to grow,</span>
  <span m='1126000'>et cetera, et cetera, and I could select. That's a very cleaver
  idea.</span> </p><p><span m='1130000'>But I'd also have to know an awful lot about
  the pathway in advance.</span> </p><p><span m='1134000'>So, suppose I didn't' know
  the pathway. Suppose I knew nothing</span> <span m='1138000'>about how arginine
  gets made. Yes? Excellent. So,</span> <span m='1143000'>I take, I mean geneticists
  are simpleminded folks and they like</span> <span m='1149000'>simple solutions.
  Take medium in which you've given</span> <span m='1155000'>the yeast arginine, grow
  it up, and then pour it out on</span> <span m='1161000'>a plate that doesn't have
  arginine. Everybody got this idea? So, we're</span> <span m='1167000'>going to take
  yeast. We're going to grow it up in medium</span> <span m='1172000'>which contains
  arginine with arginine. So,</span> <span m='1177000'>now yeasts, those mutants that
  arose by chance that are unable to make</span> <span m='1182000'>their own arginine
  are still able to grow here. And then we dump it out</span> <span m='1187000'>onto
  a plate that has minimal media without arginine,</span> <span m='1192000'>no arginine,
  and those ones that can grow up are the ones that we're not</span> <span m='1197000'>interested
  in. And the ones that don't appear are</span> <span m='1202000'>the ones we're interested
  in. But, wait a second, that's the</span> <span m='1207000'>problem, isn't it, because
  they're not here.</span> </p><p><span m='1212000'>How do we study them if they're
  not there? What can we do about that?</span> </p><p><span m='1217000'>Yes. You want
  to see if you can help us. Remove the ones that grew</span> <span m='1222000'>up.
  So, get in there, scrap them off, now put some</span> <span m='1227000'>arginine
  on. We're getting to the idea.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>Maybe we can set
  this up more elegantly, though.</span> </p><p><span m='1242000'>Thoughts? How can
  we, yes? Make a bet? Make a guess?</span> </p><p><span m='1251000'>I can make that
  guess, but how do I find them?</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>Here's a simple,
  simple, simple idea.</span> </p><p><span m='1266000'>Let me try a simple idea. How
  about I grow up these yeast,</span> <span m='1273000'>and instead of plating them
  on minimal medium,</span> <span m='1279000'>let's be good to them. Let's plate them
  on minimal medium.</span> </p><p><span m='1286000'>Good. That's interesting. Let's
  plate them on minimal medium</span> <span m='1292000'>plus arginine. Or, actually,
  if we wanted to,</span> <span m='1298000'>we could even plate them on rich medium.
  We'll be really good to</span> <span m='1303000'>them. Either way. So, now, let's
  let each one grow up.</span> </p><p><span m='1309000'>And here will be the ones
  that can grow and the ones that can't</span> <span m='1315000'>grow with arginine.
  Now let me take a plate that is</span> <span m='1320000'>minimal medium. And now
  let me take a toothpick,</span> <span m='1324000'>put a little toothpick there and
  carry over this colony to there.</span> </p><p><span m='1328000'>Let me take a toothpick
  and carry this guy over to here and a</span> <span m='1333000'>toothpick and carry
  this guy to here, and a toothpick,</span> <span m='1337000'>and a toothpick, and
  a toothpick. And all I have to do is keep</span> <span m='1341000'>transferring,
  one at a time, these colonies.</span> </p><p><span m='1346000'>And now I can see
  that somewhere there was a colony that grew fine</span> <span m='1349000'>when I
  gave it, say, rich medium,</span> <span m='1353000'>or minimal plus arginine, and
  a colony that didn't grow when I</span> <span m='1356000'>put it on minimal medium.
  That would at least show,</span> <span m='1360000'>so, of course, the issue is I
  first have to find them by growing them on</span> <span m='1363000'>something where
  I've given the arginine and then I can see that</span> <span m='1367000'>they can't
  grow. All right. This is what</span> <span m='1371000'>geneticists basically do.
  What happens if I grew them on rich</span> <span m='1374000'>medium and I transferred
  them to minimal medium? Why might</span> <span m='1378000'>something not grow? It
  might be missing the ability to</span> <span m='1382000'>make tryptophan. It might
  be missing the ability to</span> <span m='1386000'>make proline. It might be missing
  the ability to make something else.</span> </p><p><span m='1390000'>So, what I can
  do is, if I wanted to, make a very broad mutant hunt.</span> </p><p><span m='1394000'>I
  could just first grow on rich medium and then plate on minimal</span> <span m='1399000'>medium
  and any yeast that has lost the ability to make some essential</span> <span m='1403000'>nutrient
  will be evident by its absence on the minimal medium plate.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1407000'>So, we have for yeasts. Yeasts that are able to grow on</span> <span
  m='1413000'>minimal media are called prototrophs. They are the wild type that can</span>
  <span m='1419000'>grow on minimal media. They can make everything themselves.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1425000'>Yeasts that need help, that cannot grow by themselves,</span>
  <span m='1431000'>that need help, that need a supplement are called auxotrophs.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1437000'>Auxo obviously meaning help. So, it's a mutant that has
  lost the</span> <span m='1443000'>ability to grow on minimal medium and that it
  needs a supplement of</span> <span m='1449000'>some kind. So, if I wanted to, I
  could just first</span> <span m='1455000'>collect lots and lots and lots of auxotrophs
  and then figure out what</span> <span m='1461000'>they need. So, I might collect
  a large collection</span> <span m='1467000'>of auxotrophs. And then test to see
  if supplying</span> <span m='1473000'>arginine rescues them. I could also test tryptophan.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1480000'>So, if I only, only, only cared about finding arginine
  auxotrophs,</span> <span m='1488000'>I could just grow them on minimal plus arginine
  and then</span> <span m='1495000'>test them on minimal. And then I would know in
  advance,</span> <span m='1500000'>these guys all grew with arginine on minimal and
  didn't grow without</span> <span m='1504000'>arginine, and I'd know it was arginine.
  Or,</span> <span m='1508000'>if I was in an expansive mood, I could test them on
  rich medium,</span> <span m='1511000'>collect everybody who's unable to grow on
  minimal,</span> <span m='1515000'>and then work out what the reason is. Is it arginine?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1519000'>Is it proline? Is it whatever? And it depends how much
  work you're</span> <span m='1522000'>interested in doing and how complete the study
  is you want to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1526000'>Either way, we could end up with
  a collection of arginine auxotrophs.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>Organisms that
  are mutant for the ability to make their own arginine</span> <span m='1535000'>and
  require it to be supplied to them in the medium.</span> </p><p><span m='1540000'>All
  right. I might get, depending on how much work I'm</span> <span m='1545000'>willing
  to do, dozens of independent colonies</span> <span m='1550000'>unable to grow without
  arginine. I might get hundreds if I'm willing</span> <span m='1555000'>to do enough
  work. I can get as many as I want.</span> </p><p><span m='1560000'>Our goal now
  is to study them and find out why they're unable to do</span> <span m='1568000'>that.
  I have a quick question? Those yeast cells we plated, where</span> <span m='1577000'>they
  haploid or diploid? We didn't say, did we? So,</span> <span m='1585000'>should they
  be haploid or diploid? How many vote diploid?</span> </p><p><span m='1593000'>How
  many vote haploid? A lot of people vote haploid but</span> <span m='1599000'>aren't
  willing to express a reason why. Why haploid?</span> </p><p><span m='1605000'>Right.
  Excellent. Excellent, although genes are not</span> <span m='1611000'>recessive,
  but OK. A little detail. Phenotypes are</span> <span m='1617000'>recessive. Tell
  me a little more of what you're</span> <span m='1622000'>thinking about. We'll have
  it out later on this</span> <span m='1627000'>point, yes. So, suppose we were looking
  in a haploid.</span> </p><p><span m='1632000'>I take your point, even if on nomenclature
  I want to</span> <span m='1637000'>push back a bit. So, suppose it's a diploid and</span>
  <span m='1642000'>suppose we have now two copies of this chromosome here</span>
  <span m='1647000'>in the diploid. And suppose there's a gene over here</span> <span
  m='1652000'>that encodes an enzyme that we now is necessary to make arginine,</span>
  <span m='1656000'>or that somebody knows is necessary to make arginine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1661000'>Let's image that that's the case. In order to get haploid yeast that</span>
  <span m='1666000'>is unable to make arginine due to a mutation in this gene,</span>
  <span m='1670000'>you need to have some kind of a mutation in this copy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1675000'>What about in the diploid yeast? In order to make this
  yeast unable</span> <span m='1680000'>to grow without arginine, do we need a mutation
  in both copies?</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>Well, the answer is probably. The
  truth is actually a bit more</span> <span m='1689000'>complicated, but let's suppose
  it was the case that even one copy of</span> <span m='1693000'>the functional gene
  was sufficient to carry out the enzymatic step,</span> <span m='1697000'>then the
  answer would be yeah, we'd need a mutation of both copies.</span> </p><p><span m='1701000'>What's
  the chance of finding a yeast that has a mutation in both</span> <span m='1705000'>copies?
  It's obviously much less than the chance of finding a yeast</span> <span m='1709000'>that
  had a mutation of one copy. So, we're much better to go</span> <span m='1713000'>searching
  in the haploid where the phenotype will be revealed much more</span> <span m='1717000'>easily
  by virtue of just the single mutation rather than having to,</span> <span m='1721000'>by
  chance, encounter one that had mutations in both copies.</span> </p><p><span m='1725000'>Now,
  the reason I'm a little bit cautious here is because</span> <span m='1730000'>notwithstanding
  the textbooks, it's not always the case that</span> <span m='1734000'>everything
  like this is a recessive trait. It's possible that</span> <span m='1738000'>auxotrophy
  for arginine could be a dominant trait.</span> </p><p><span m='1743000'>So, how
  could that be? Well, auxotrophy could be a</span> <span m='1746000'>recessive trait.
  Suppose there's some enzymatic</span> <span m='1749000'>pathway, A goes to B goes
  to C goes to D, and this encodes an enzyme</span> <span m='1752000'>that carries
  out a particular biochemical step.</span> </p><p><span m='1756000'>Well, if the
  gene is broken, if the gene is missing, if the gene</span> <span m='1759000'>doesn't
  make the protein, as you guys all know that that's</span> <span m='1762000'>what
  happens, then you don't have the enzyme, you can't do the pathway.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1765000'>And it is usually the case that having just one copy is sufficient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1769000'>Because having a little bit of enzyme the pathway may work
  slower</span> <span m='1772000'>but it will still work just fine and you'll eventually
  get arginine made.</span> </p><p><span m='1775000'>But it's occasionally possible,
  I note since you guys are</span> <span m='1779000'>sophisticated, that sometimes
  a gene can encode a</span> <span m='1782000'>protein which not only doesn't work
  but screws up the other working</span> <span m='1786000'>copies of the protein.
  Suppose the enzyme that did this</span> <span m='1789000'>were a tetramer. It had
  several subunits that had</span> <span m='1793000'>come together. A mutant copy
  of an enzyme,</span> <span m='1797000'>when it forms into a tetramer, might somehow
  disrupt all the other</span> <span m='1803000'>good copies that are around. And
  that does happen sometimes.</span> </p><p><span m='1809000'>It can happen that you're
  going to have an inability to make your own</span> <span m='1814000'>arginine be
  a dominantly inherited trait. So, you actually have to</span> <span m='1820000'>test
  whether it's recessive or dominant. Often it will be</span> <span m='1826000'>recessive.
  So, usually most of these simple</span> <span m='1832000'>auxotrophs are recessive
  traits. Occasionally some are dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='1837000'>So, now,
  suppose we get a whole collection of Arg auxotrophs,</span> <span m='1843000'>and
  we'll just give them a name. I don't know. Here's my collection.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1849000'>We'll call the first one, for lack of anything terribly</span> <span
  m='1854000'>creative, Arg 1, Arg 2, Arg 3, et cetera,</span> <span m='1860000'>each
  being an individual strain from growing up originally for a single</span> <span
  m='1866000'>colony that is unable to produce its own arginine.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1872000'>We now want to take this collection and characterize it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1877000'>How many distinct genes does this affect? Are these mutants perhaps</span>
  <span m='1882000'>all in the same gene? Are they in a hundred different</span> <span
  m='1888000'>genes? How could we tell? Now, of course,</span> <span m='1892000'>if
  you're a biochemist, you already know the protein you can</span> <span m='1896000'>see
  and dah, dah, dah. But, if you know the answer,</span> <span m='1899000'>well, why
  are asking then, right? A geneticist goes out to ask this</span> <span m='1902000'>question
  because he or she wants to know all the possible ways you can</span> <span m='1906000'>disrupt
  the cell so it cannot make arginine. And we don't know in</span> <span m='1909000'>advance
  what those ways are, so how are we going to be able to</span> <span m='1913000'>tell
  whether or not different mutations affect the same gene,</span> <span m='1916000'>the
  same function in yeast? It's an interesting question.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>Geneticists
  do a variety of tests. The first test that a geneticist</span> <span m='1930000'>does
  to characterize a mutant is by tests of recessivity or dominance,</span> <span m='1940000'>whichever
  way you want to put it.</span> </p><p><span m='1950000'>We want to take each mutant
  and test whether it is recessive or dominant</span> <span m='1953000'>as a phenotype,
  whether the phenotype,</span> <span m='1957000'>the auxotrophy for arginine is recessive
  or dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='1960000'>So, here's mutant number one, the mutant
  cell carrying this</span> <span m='1964000'>mutation here. Conceptually it affects
  some gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1967000'>I'm going to label it Arg 1. We don't
  know where it is in the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='1971000'>There are other
  chromosomes here as well. Here's my mutant cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1974000'>How
  am I going to find out whether or not the auxotrophy for arginine</span> <span m='1978000'>is
  recessive or dominant? Yup? With what?</span> </p><p><span m='1983000'>Cross it
  with a haploid that is a prototroph, or I could just say</span> <span m='1989000'>cross
  it with wild type, right? Perfect. So, make a cross</span> <span m='1995000'>here,
  very good, with wild type plus there.</span> </p><p><span m='2001000'>How do I know
  it's plus there? This is wild type. Wild type is</span> <span m='2007000'>defined
  as the normal form. And so, because I said this is what</span> <span m='2012000'>we're
  using as wild type, it's necessarily plus because we're</span> <span m='2017000'>measuring
  mutations relative to wild type. So, what happens when we get</span> <span m='2022000'>here?
  We now, when we cross we get a diploid,</span> <span m='2027000'>and Arg 1 plus.
  Now, how do we know whether or not that phenotype was</span> <span m='2032000'>recessive
  or dominant? Sorry? It's what shows up when we</span> <span m='2037000'>try to grow
  it. So, when we cross it,</span> <span m='2042000'>what kind of plate should we
  grow it on first? Should we grow it on</span> <span m='2047000'>minimal or rich?
  We better grow it on rich because</span> <span m='2052000'>just in case it doesn't,
  it can't make its own arginine,</span> <span m='2057000'>we better first let it
  grow and then test it. So, let's grow it on rich</span> <span m='2062000'>medium.
  We'll cross these together, grow it on rich medium. So, grow on</span> <span m='2067000'>rich,
  test on minimal. OK? And we'll be able to check out</span> <span m='2072000'>the
  phenotype as to whether or not the phenotype is wild type or mutant.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2076000'>All right. So, we could do that.</span> </p><p><span m='2081000'>And
  we'll test the first one and the second one and third one and the</span> <span m='2085000'>fourth
  one. And, for each of these,</span> <span m='2090000'>we'll write down whether it's
  recessive or a dominant auxotroph.</span> </p><p><span m='2095000'>Now, let me assume
  that all the ones we're talking about are</span> <span m='2099000'>recessive phenotypes.
  Because everything I'm about to say</span> <span m='2104000'>is very much harder
  if it turned out any of them were dominant.</span> </p><p><span m='2110000'>So,
  we're going to assume. Let's assume now, but it's not</span> <span m='2116000'>always
  the case, we'll assume that the collection,</span> <span m='2121000'>maybe Arg 100,
  are all recessive auxotrophies, the phenotype</span> <span m='2127000'>is recessive.
  Now, how do I tell if they're in the</span> <span m='2135000'>same gene or not?
  So, now I want to characterize my</span> <span m='2145000'>mutant by some other
  test that will tell me whether or not Arg 1 and Arg</span> <span m='2155000'>2 are
  in the same gene. Suppose Arg 1 and Arg 2 are in</span> <span m='2163000'>different
  genes. Cross them. What will happen?</span> </p><p><span m='2171000'>Right. So,
  to repeat that, if I cross together the two mutants and</span> <span m='2179000'>they're
  in different genes, each will have at least, the each</span> <span m='2186000'>will
  be contributing a good copy, a functional copy, a wild type copy</span> <span m='2194000'>of
  one of the genes. So, let's walk this through.</span> </p><p><span m='2200000'>Interesting.
  Interesting. So, suppose I take a situation where</span> <span m='2205000'>I've
  got Arg 1, a mutation in a gene over here,</span> <span m='2210000'>on this chromosome,
  and on the other chromosome I've got a wild type copy.</span> </p><p><span m='2215000'>My
  Arg 1 mutant is mutated in a gene here.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>I've got
  this other gene here, which is normal. And I'm going to</span> <span m='2227000'>cross
  that now by the strain that has a wild type copy here for this</span> <span m='2234000'>first
  gene, but it has a mutation in the second gene.</span> </p><p><span m='2241000'>When
  I cross them together, I now get me a diploid cell here,</span> <span m='2248000'>which
  is Arg 1, a mutation there, plus there, plus copy</span> <span m='2255000'>here,
  and Arg 2. Will having one copy,</span> <span m='2261000'>one working copy of this
  gene be enough to make the enzyme?</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>No? In other
  words, is the wild type phenotype dominant to this</span> <span m='2273000'>auxotrophy,
  or is the auxotrophy attributable to this</span> <span m='2279000'>gene recessive?
  Yes. Why? Because we assumed it.</span> </p><p><span m='2284000'>Why did we assume
  it? So I would be able to say this,</span> <span m='2289000'>right? OK. If it wasn't
  we'd be in trouble. But by assuming that we're</span> <span m='2294000'>working
  with a recessive phenotype, then we know that this will be</span> <span m='2299000'>enough
  to save the yeast. What about here? Enough to save</span> <span m='2304000'>the
  yeast so it will grow without arginine.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>By contrast,
  suppose it was the case that this cell here,</span> <span m='2318000'>Arg 1, and
  suppose our other mutant that we had isolated in our mutant</span> <span m='2327000'>hunt
  was a mutation Arg 2 in the same gene. Suppose these were the</span> <span m='2336000'>same
  gene. When I cross them together I now have a cell</span> <span m='2345000'>that
  is Arg 1, Arg 2. In other words,</span> <span m='2354000'>its genotype is Arg 1
  over Arg 2, name of mutation. And can it grow?</span> </p><p><span m='2364000'>No
  growth without arginine. By contrast, the genotype here is Arg 1</span> <span m='2374000'>over
  plus, plus over Arg 2. I could even write Arg 2 over plus,</span> <span m='2383000'>but
  I just did that to indicate the chromosomes that they came from.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2391000'>All right. This is called a Test of Complementation because these two</span>
  <span m='2399000'>genes are able to compliment each other's defect.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2407000'>If two mutations compliment each other's defect then they are in</span>
  <span m='2418000'>different genes. OK? Boy, that's a noisy one.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2430000'>So, we're able to make a Complementation Table.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2436000'>Suppose I take a bunch of yeasts, wild type, WT, mutant number one,</span>
  <span m='2443000'>mutant number two, mutant number three,</span> <span m='2449000'>mutant
  number four. And suppose I cross them with each other in all</span> <span m='2456000'>pair-wise
  combinations. I've assumed that all of these</span> <span m='2462000'>arginine auxotrophs
  have a recessive phenotype here.</span> </p><p><span m='2467000'>These are all my
  Arg mutants, and I'm assuming that this is</span> <span m='2472000'>recessive. What
  happens when I cross them and I test to see whether</span> <span m='2477000'>they
  can grow without arginine? If I cross wild type by wild type,</span> <span m='2482000'>can
  it grow without arginine? Yeah. Normal phenotype. So, plus is</span> <span m='2487000'>going
  to mean prototrophic. Minus will mean auxotrophic for</span> <span m='2492000'>arginine.
  What happens when I cross wild type with mutant number one?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2496000'>It grows. Why? By assumption, these were all recessive.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2501000'>I'm only testing recessive ones. Two. Three. Four. When I cross</span>
  <span m='2506000'>in this direction, wild type by these guys.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2510000'>This is going to be a symmetric matrix, of course,</span> <span m='2515000'>right?
  OK. Now, what happens when I cross mutant one by mutant one?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2520000'>I now have a diploid. Will it be able to grow without</span> <span m='2524000'>arginine?
  No. Why not? It has no working copies</span> <span m='2528000'>of that gene, so
  I'm going to put a minus there. What about mutant two</span> <span m='2532000'>with
  mutant two? Minus. What about mutant three</span> <span m='2536000'>with mutant
  three? Minus. What about mutant four with</span> <span m='2540000'>mutant four?
  Minus. Now, what happens when I cross</span> <span m='2544000'>mutant one by mutant
  two? It depends. It might be plus or</span> <span m='2548000'>might be minus. If
  they're in the same gene,</span> <span m='2552000'>minus. Different genes, could
  be plus. So, here's some data.</span> </p><p><span m='2558000'>So, all this is compelled.
  But the kind of data, ooh,</span> <span m='2563000'>I'll use a color. Isn't that
  fun? They want me to use colors over</span> <span m='2569000'>there. Here we go.
  Suppose the data were minus,</span> <span m='2574000'>minus, plus, plus, plus, plus,
  minus, minus, plus, plus, plus,</span> <span m='2580000'>plus. What would it be?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2586000'>What conclusion could we draw? Is mutant one and mutant
  three in</span> <span m='2593000'>the same gene? They compliment each other?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2600000'>No. But is one in the same gene as two? Yes. In fact,</span>
  <span m='2607000'>this box and this box here define the genes beautifully.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2614000'>The groups that failed to compliment define mutations in
  the same gene.</span> </p><p><span m='2617000'>These are called Complementation
  Groups because they don't compliment,</span> <span m='2621000'>OK? It's a little
  complicated but that's all right.</span> </p><p><span m='2625000'>These are called
  Complementation Groups because all the members of</span> <span m='2628000'>the complementation
  group, namely Arg 1 and Arg 2, failed to</span> <span m='2632000'>compliment each
  other. They could be called failure to</span> <span m='2636000'>compliment groups,
  but it would be too long.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>OK? So, there you go.
  You can take hundreds of mutants</span> <span m='2644000'>and organize them into
  complementation groups and thereby</span> <span m='2649000'>know which ones go to
  the same gene. And now, if I want to study the</span> <span m='2653000'>genes, I
  only have to study the distinct complementation groups.</span> </p><p><span m='2658000'>Last
  thing, which we'll just have time to do, are what's called tests</span> <span m='2663000'>of
  epistasis. We'll probably run just a moment or two over on this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2668000'>Suppose a biochemist were collaborating with a geneticist and</span>
  <span m='2674000'>had studied what he or she thought was the pathway for making
  arginine.</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>Some precursor alpha goes to precursor
  beta,</span> <span m='2687000'>goes to precursor gamma, goes to arginine. And suppose</span>
  <span m='2693000'>specific genes were needed to encode specific proteins.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2700000'>I'll call them Arg A, Arg B, Arg C to catalyze each step</span>
  <span m='2705000'>of this biochemical reaction. The geneticist and the biochemist</span>
  <span m='2710000'>could collaborate with each other to study whether these mutants,</span>
  <span m='2715000'>these particular genes now that had been identified,</span> <span
  m='2720000'>affected each step of the pathway. And here's how they might do it.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2726000'>They might take wild type yeast, mutant, well, they wouldn't
  know in</span> <span m='2730000'>advance whether or not it was missing the ability
  to grow on each</span> <span m='2734000'>of, whether it was missing each of these
  enzymes,</span> <span m='2738000'>but let's think conceptually. Suppose we had a
  mutant that was,</span> <span m='2742000'>a strain that was wild type, Arg A minus,
  Arg B, minus,</span> <span m='2746000'>Arg C minus, unable to make this enzyme,
  this enzyme,</span> <span m='2750000'>this enzyme. And suppose we helped it along.
  Suppose we gave the</span> <span m='2754000'>mutant arginine. Suppose we supplement
  and grow it</span> <span m='2758000'>on media with arginine. Which ones will be
  able to grow with</span> <span m='2762000'>arginine? Can wild type grow if it's
  given arginine?</span> </p><p><span m='2768000'>What about Arg A minus? B minus?
  C minus? What if instead</span> <span m='2773000'>we offer it precursor gamma? Will
  wild type be able to grow if</span> <span m='2779000'>it's given precursor gamma?
  Sure. What about Arg A minus?</span> </p><p><span m='2784000'>No, because it still
  is stuck at this step.</span> </p><p><span m='2790000'>It cannot. What about Arg
  B minus? What about Arg C minus? Really?</span> </p><p><span m='2795000'>It hasn't
  got this enzyme. What's it going to do with gamma?</span> </p><p><span m='2801000'>It
  ain't got anything to do with gamma, no enzyme.</span> </p><p><span m='2807000'>Suppose
  I gave it beta. Wild type, can it grow? What about</span> <span m='2813000'>Arg
  A minus? No, because it can go from alpha to beta,</span> <span m='2819000'>but
  it can't go to gamma. It cannot grow.</span> </p><p><span m='2824000'>What about
  Arg B minus? I've given it beta, but it can't do</span> <span m='2830000'>anything
  with beta because it hasn't got this gene.</span> </p><p><span m='2836000'>What
  about Arg C minus? Wait a second. What did I just do?</span> </p><p><span m='2841000'>We're
  just backward. Sorry. If we gave it gamma, I just</span> <span m='2847000'>got lost
  here. If we gave it gamma it was able to</span> <span m='2852000'>grow, well, we
  are completely wrong, guys. It's able to grow here.</span> </p><p><span m='2856000'>Thank
  you. Let's go back on that. You should have caught me before.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2860000'>My mistake. If we have it gamma it's able to, if it's a mutant here</span>
  <span m='2864000'>it can grow because it bypasses this problem. And having gamma
  is enough.</span> </p><p><span m='2868000'>If I gave it beta, sorry, if I gave it
  gamma and its</span> <span m='2872000'>mutation was here it can grow. Sorry.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877000'>Now, if I gave it here beta, and its mutation was here,
  it can</span> <span m='2882000'>still grow, right? But if its mutation is here it</span>
  <span m='2887000'>can't and if its mutation is here it can't. That's better.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2892000'>I was getting worried there for a while myself. Suppose
  I gave it</span> <span m='2897000'>alpha. Wild type can grow. If I give this guy
  alpha, will that</span> <span m='2902000'>help if he's mutant in A? No. Can it help
  if he's mutant in</span> <span m='2907000'>B? No. Can it help if he's mutant in
  C?</span> </p><p><span m='2912000'>No. Sorry. There we go. I usually start at the
  other end of</span> <span m='2917000'>this picture. So, what you can see is these
  mutants</span> <span m='2922000'>have different phenotypes with respect to being
  able to supplement</span> <span m='2927000'>them with different chemicals. Now,
  let me ask in our last two</span> <span m='2932000'>minutes, I'll run two minutes
  over here. Suppose I gave you a mutant</span> <span m='2937000'>that was a double
  homozygote. Suppose it was Arg B minus,</span> <span m='2943000'>Arg B minus, sorry,
  Arg B minus and Arg C minus. Suppose it was a</span> <span m='2949000'>double mutant,
  it lacked both this and this.</span> </p><p><span m='2956000'>Which line of my table
  would it resemble? Would it look like the</span> <span m='2963000'>first line, the
  second line or the third line of my table?</span> </p><p><span m='2970000'>Second
  line. Why's that? If I'm lacking B, I'm already in</span> <span m='2976000'>trouble
  here. And also lacking C doesn't matter.</span> </p><p><span m='2982000'>So, I will
  look, just like a mutant who lacks B.</span> </p><p><span m='2989000'>So, in other
  words, I'm able, if I know something about the</span> <span m='2995000'>biochemistry
  of a pathway and I can break my arginine mutants up into</span> <span m='3002000'>different
  kinds of phenotypes here by their response to different steps</span> <span m='3008000'>in
  a pathway, I can then look at combinations of mutants.</span> </p><p><span m='3015000'>And
  I can say if I have a double mutant missing both B and C,</span> <span m='3020000'>does
  it look like B or does it look C when I put them together?</span> </p><p><span m='3025000'>And
  it turns out that if it looks like B then B was further upstream</span> <span m='3031000'>in
  the pathway. So, it turns out that geneticists</span> <span m='3036000'>and biochemists
  can collaborate based on the phenotype of the</span> <span m='3040000'>organism
  sometimes to infer aspects of the biochemical pathway.</span> </p><p><span m='3045000'>These
  are the kinds of things a geneticist does to be able to</span> <span m='3049000'>characterize
  mutants on a mutant hunt. Next time what I want to do</span> <span m='3054000'>is
  talk about characterizing mutants in a very different kind of organism,</span> <span
  m='3058000'>namely the human being.</span> </p>
