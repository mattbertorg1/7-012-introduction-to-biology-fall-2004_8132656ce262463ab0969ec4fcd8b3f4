title: 'Lecture 23: Immunology 2'
transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>Recall, please, that we were discussing last time</span>\
  \ <span m='5000'>the fact that the immune system makes a wide diversity of antibody</span>\
  \ <span m='10000'>molecules. And, by the way, a synonym for an</span> <span m='15000'>antibody\
  \ molecule is an immunoglobulin.</span> </p><p><span m='20000'>Recall that we used\
  \ that word very briefly. Another word we use,</span> <span m='25000'>by the way,\
  \ was the word antigen. And, an antigen is a functional term.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='30000'>That was pretty funny. An antigen is a functional term.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='34000'>An antigen is an agent that provokes an immune response.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='39000'>And, the term antigen doesn't really refer to any specific</span> <span\
  \ m='43000'>chemical structure. It doesn't even have to be a</span> <span m='48000'>protein.\
  \ Antigen simply refers to some chemical entity that creates</span> <span m='53000'>some\
  \ response from the immune system. We also use the word in</span> <span m='57000'>passing,\
  \ epitope. And, an epitope refers to a small</span> <span m='62000'>region, for\
  \ example, a protein against which an antibody</span> <span m='66000'>has developed\
  \ reactivity. And if you recall our discussion</span> <span m='71000'>last time,\
  \ a protein obviously of some size has multiple distinct</span> <span m='75000'>epitopes,\
  \ each of which can be recognized by a distinct antibody</span> <span m='79000'>molecule.\
  \ And, for us, could we,</span> <span m='84000'>I'm sorry if I got all this political\
  \ discussion</span> <span m='88000'>started, thank you. Thank you. An epitope,</span>\
  \ <span m='92000'>from the point of view of a protein is an oligo peptide.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='96000'>So, a stretch of amino acids of maybe ten, or 12,</span>\
  \ <span m='100000'>or 15 amino acids forms an epitope. And therefore, you can imagine</span>\
  \ <span m='104000'>there are multiple epitopes on the surface of a protein.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='108000'>In fact, antibodies can sometimes recognize the internal\
  \ parts of the</span> <span m='112000'>protein because protein can sometimes become\
  \ denatured</span> <span m='116000'>or degraded. Indeed, as we will discuss shortly,</span>\
  \ <span m='120000'>proteins also become cleaved into oligo peptides.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='124000'>These oligo peptides can come from any part of the protein,</span>\
  \ <span m='128000'>to state the obvious, and therefore there might be internal epitopes</span>\
  \ <span m='132000'>that exist in a protein that are not normally exposed by the\
  \ native</span> <span m='137000'>protein. Recall that we were dealing with the issue\
  \ of how the</span> <span m='141000'>immune system is able to create a wide diversity\
  \ of antibodies,</span> <span m='145000'>immunoglobulins would share in common a\
  \ constant domain.</span> </p><p><span m='150000'>And the constant domain is formed\
  \ by these invariant regions of the light</span> <span m='154000'>and the heavy\
  \ chains. We call this the heterotetramer in</span> <span m='158000'>contrast to\
  \ the variable domain up here which recognizes the antigen</span> <span m='162000'>that\
  \ initially provoked the production of this antibody molecule.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='166000'>And, the immune system may at any one point in time be making hundreds</span>\
  \ <span m='170000'>of thousands, maybe even millions or tens of millions of distinct</span>\
  \ <span m='174000'>antibody species that differ one from the other by the antigen</span>\
  \ <span m='178000'>recognition site here at this part of the antibody molecule.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='183000'>And recall as well that since these are proteins, the</span>\
  \ <span m='187000'>antigen-recognizing pocket is itself an oligopeptide,</span>\
  \ <span m='191000'>which combined in some complementary fashion to whatever antigen</span>\
  \ <span m='195000'>initially provoked the synthesis of this antibody molecule.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='200000'>At the end of last time, we discussed the fact that</span>\
  \ <span m='204000'>antibodies are made by B cells, and the fact that in the disease\
  \ of</span> <span m='208000'>multiple myeloma, one ends up with a monoclonal</span>\
  \ <span m='213000'>disease, that is to say, one of a vastly heterogeneous</span>\
  \ <span m='217000'>population of B cells begins to proliferate uncontrollably.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='222000'>And now, all of its descendants make a single antibody\
  \ species.</span> </p><p><span m='226000'>And that single antibody species consists\
  \ once again of a heavy and a</span> <span m='231000'>light chain, whose identity\
  \ is created by the antigen-recognizing</span> <span m='235000'>pocket that it happens\
  \ to carry. And this begins to suggest a notion</span> <span m='240000'>of clonal\
  \ expansion. By that, I mean the following.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>Let's\
  \ imagine a scenario where we start out with a na\xEFve immune system</span> <span\
  \ m='248000'>where we have a whole series of different B cells.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='252000'>And this series goes here from 1-15, but in fact this could go from\
  \ one</span> <span m='257000'>up to a million. And each of these antibody</span>\
  \ <span m='261000'>producing B cells, or each of these B cells,</span> <span m='265000'>has\
  \ in principle the ability to respond to a different antigen.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='270000'>Let's just imagine that. And now, what we can imagine is</span> <span\
  \ m='274000'>that an antigen such as, for example, poliovirus comes into</span>\
  \ <span m='278000'>the body, and it is recognized by two different clones of these\
  \ B</span> <span m='282000'>cells. And that recognition, we can imagine, acts as\
  \ a mytogenic</span> <span m='287000'>signal, a growth stimulatory signal for these\
  \ two particular clones and</span> <span m='291000'>B cells. It almost acts as if\
  \ it were a growth factor.</span> </p><p><span m='295000'>But of course, we're not\
  \ talking about growth factors here.</span> </p><p><span m='300000'>We're talking\
  \ about antigens, including antigens brought into the</span> <span m='304000'>tissue\
  \ by a foreign infectious agent. And therefore,</span> <span m='309000'>the recognition\
  \ of the antigen by these two B cells may thereafter</span> <span m='313000'>provoke\
  \ their clonal expansion. By that I mean to say that they</span> <span m='318000'>will\
  \ preferentially begin to proliferate whereas all the other B</span> <span m='323000'>cells,\
  \ which are not in any way responsive to that antigen will just</span> <span m='327000'>sit\
  \ there like bumps on a log. And, if there is,</span> <span m='332000'>therefore,\
  \ clonal expansion, now there will be a much larger</span> <span m='336000'>number\
  \ of cells in the immune system that are capable of producing the</span> <span m='340000'>antibody\
  \ that recognizes its provoking antigen.</span> </p><p><span m='344000'>Again, recall\
  \ that this number may go up to a million.</span> </p><p><span m='348000'>This is\
  \ just a great simplification. Now here, we use the word plasma</span> <span m='352000'>cells.\
  \ And in fact, if one wants to get the nomenclature</span> <span m='356000'>very\
  \ proper, the plasma cells are the products of B cells which mature</span> <span\
  \ m='360000'>into the antibody producing plasma cells.</span> </p><p><span m='364000'>They\
  \ are very close on the same lineage of cells,</span> <span m='367000'>and what\
  \ that means in the end for us is if once there's an active</span> <span m='371000'>immune\
  \ response, there's been the preferential</span> <span m='375000'>expansion of certain\
  \ sub-populations of B cells and plasma cells,</span> <span m='378000'>and other\
  \ ones of them which don't recognize these antigens just sit</span> <span m='382000'>there\
  \ are underrepresented in the total population of cells.</span> </p><p><span m='386000'>Still,\
  \ the fundamental question that we posed last time</span> <span m='390000'>was the\
  \ following. If it's the case,</span> <span m='394000'>and it happens to be that\
  \ each of these B cells makes an antibody</span> <span m='398000'>having a distinct\
  \ reactivity, a distinct ability to react to one</span> <span m='402000'>or another\
  \ antigen how do they make so many different kinds of antibody</span> <span m='406000'>molecules.\
  \ How do they know how to do that. We argued that it's</span> <span m='410000'>implausible\
  \ that the amino acid sequences of each antibody molecule</span> <span m='414000'>are\
  \ encoded in the germ line. Why? Well, if there are indeed a</span> <span m='418000'>million\
  \ or even 100 million distinct antibodies can be made by the immune</span> <span\
  \ m='422000'>system, clearly there can't be 100 million genes,</span> <span m='426000'>each\
  \ of which is dedicated to the production of a distinct</span> <span m='430000'>antibody\
  \ molecule. And the solution to this puzzle was</span> <span m='434000'>first worked\
  \ out by Susumu Tonegawa already more than 20 years ago who</span> <span m='438000'>happens\
  \ to be in our biology department. And what he discovered</span> <span m='442000'>was\
  \ the following, that the way that the antibody</span> <span m='446000'>producing\
  \ genes are organized is really quite extraordinary</span> <span m='450000'>and\
  \ unusual. Here's the heavy chain of the gene,</span> <span m='455000'>and keep\
  \ in mind that there's a heavy and a light chain gene.</span> </p><p><span m='459000'>The\
  \ heavy and the light chain genes are in different chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='463000'>And therefore, the genes that are responsible for encoding these two</span>\
  \ <span m='468000'>proteins, the heavy and the light chain, they're on different</span>\
  \ <span m='472000'>chromosomes, and encode by different genes. OK, so what Tonegawa</span>\
  \ <span m='476000'>discovered was the following, that the variable region of an</span>\
  \ <span m='481000'>antibody molecule which is at its end terminus is encoded by\
  \ small</span> <span m='485000'>segments of DNA that are carried in one very large\
  \ genetic locus,</span> <span m='489000'>an immunoglobulin locus. And what happens\
  \ in humans is the</span> <span m='494000'>following. There are in humans rather\
  \ than mice,</span> <span m='499000'>this number should be 100 in humans, there\
  \ are 100 distinct V segments</span> <span m='504000'>that are encoded in this antibody\
  \ locus. Each one is roughly the same</span> <span m='509000'>size, and they're\
  \ located in a large tandem array.</span> </p><p><span m='514000'>Similarly, there\
  \ are in humans 30 of these desegments.</span> </p><p><span m='517000'>The numbers\
  \ change here if one goes from mouse to human,</span> <span m='521000'>but that's\
  \ irrelevant. And, there are six of the J</span> <span m='525000'>segments. And,\
  \ much of the antigen-recognizing</span> <span m='529000'>capacity, much of the\
  \ variable region is encoded in the green and</span> <span m='533000'>the blue region\
  \ of the gene, and the encoding happens as follows.</span> </p><p><span m='537000'>There\
  \ is a combinatorial fashion the</span> <span m='541000'>random fusion of V, D,\
  \ and J segments. There are</span> <span m='545000'>specific, highly specialized\
  \ enzyme that will choose one specific V</span> <span m='550000'>segment, one specific\
  \ D segment, and one specific J segment,</span> <span m='554000'>ostensibly on a\
  \ stochastic basis, a totally random basis, and fuse</span> <span m='558000'>them\
  \ together. And if that happens,</span> <span m='563000'>and the intervening DNA\
  \ sequences are discarded,</span> <span m='567000'>then right away we can see that\
  \ through the combinatorial</span> <span m='571000'>mathematics that results from\
  \ this, there is the possibility for having</span> <span m='576000'>100 times 30,\
  \ which is 3, 00, times six, which is already 180,</span> <span m='580000'>00 distinct\
  \ combinations encoding the reading frame of this particular</span> <span m='584000'>antibody\
  \ molecule. Here, I've just said V23,</span> <span m='589000'>I guess, D7, J2. But\
  \ again, let's imagine, which is</span> <span m='593000'>approximately the case,\
  \ that each of these combinations can</span> <span m='597000'>be fused with roughly\
  \ equal probability.</span> </p><p><span m='602000'>What happens subsequently, then,\
  \ is that this variable region</span> <span m='606000'>sequence, which has been\
  \ formed by fusion, is then the transcript that</span> <span m='610000'>comes from\
  \ that is spliced to the constant region which is towards the</span> <span m='614000'>C\
  \ terminus. So here, when we talk about the V,</span> <span m='618000'>D, and J\
  \ segments, we're talking about the segments that are encoding</span> <span m='622000'>this\
  \ portion. Here's this portion of the antibody molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='626000'>Keep\
  \ in mind, from here on down, we're talking about constant region</span> <span m='630000'>segments\
  \ which are not affected by these combinatorial fusions.</span> </p><p><span m='635000'>And,\
  \ in the overhead I just showed you, I was just talking about how</span> <span m='639000'>the\
  \ heavy chain gene is rearranged. And what that results as a</span> <span m='643000'>consequence\
  \ is the following. This is just another version of</span> <span m='647000'>what\
  \ I just showed you before, where the V, D, and J segments</span> <span m='652000'>become\
  \ fused randomly to one another creating a V, D,</span> <span m='656000'>J fusion\
  \ thing, which then by splicing is fused to the constant</span> <span m='660000'>region\
  \ which here is called C sub-mu.</span> </p><p><span m='665000'>For reasons of why\
  \ it's called sub-mu I'll mention in a moment.</span> </p><p><span m='668000'>And\
  \ this is the actual messenger RNA which then goes into the</span> <span m='672000'>cytoplasm.\
  \ And what we can now imagine is the following,</span> <span m='676000'>that when\
  \ the immune system first begins, it randomly fuses whole</span> <span m='679000'>series\
  \ of V, D, and J segments together,</span> <span m='683000'>and all kinds of combinations.\
  \ The same happens in both the heavy</span> <span m='687000'>chain and the light\
  \ chain, although the light chain is slightly</span> <span m='691000'>simpler. But\
  \ that's irrelevant for us</span> <span m='694000'>conceptually. And then, we end\
  \ up having hundreds of</span> <span m='698000'>millions of distinct V cells, each\
  \ of which has a different</span> <span m='702000'>combination of heavy and light\
  \ chains because keep in mind the</span> <span m='706000'>light chain genes are\
  \ also being rearranged combinatorially.</span> </p><p><span m='710000'>They're\
  \ also being fused. And therefore, we can have 180,</span> <span m='714000'>00 distinct\
  \ heavy chains, and I forget the exact number for the</span> <span m='718000'>number\
  \ of light chains. It's a bit less,</span> <span m='722000'>but we can multiply\
  \ those two combinations by one another because</span> <span m='726000'>keep in\
  \ mind that the gene encoding the heavy chain here in its variable</span> <span\
  \ m='730000'>region, and the gene encoding the light chain in its variable region</span>\
  \ <span m='734000'>are organized on separate chromosomes. And,</span> <span m='738000'>they're\
  \ fused together. These segments are fused together</span> <span m='742000'>randomly.\
  \ So, the total number of antibody</span> <span m='746000'>molecules we can make\
  \ is 180, 00 distinct kinds of these.</span> </p><p><span m='750000'>And, I've just\
  \ slipped up in knowing the total number of these that can</span> <span m='754000'>be\
  \ made, although we could figure it out shortly if it were really</span> <span m='758000'>important.\
  \ But once again, the number is in the many thousands.</span> </p><p><span m='762000'>And\
  \ therefore, overall, the total number of distinct antibody</span> <span m='766000'>molecules\
  \ one can make on the basis of this is this.</span> </p><p><span m='770000'>Did\
  \ I get the math right, 60 by 30, 18,000. It's 18,</span> <span m='774000'>00. So,\
  \ there's 18,000 distinct of these that can be made,</span> <span m='778000'>and\
  \ the number of these, I think, is closer to 10,000.</span> </p><p><span m='782000'>I\
  \ forget, but multiplied, let's call it 10,000 for a moment.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='786000'>That's not the right number. There's 10,000 different ones of</span>\
  \ <span m='791000'>these, and 18, 00 of these that can be made.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='796000'>Multiply them together, and you get the total number of combinations\
  \ of</span> <span m='800000'>antibody molecules it could make because it is the\
  \ case that the</span> <span m='805000'>antigen recognition site here is created\
  \ cooperatively,</span> <span m='810000'>collaboratively, by the heavy and light\
  \ chain. You had a question?</span> </p><p><span m='815000'>So, the gene is rearranged,\
  \ and when the rearrangement occurs,</span> <span m='819000'>on V segment is fused\
  \ to one D segment, is fused to one J segment.</span> </p><p><span m='824000'>And\
  \ all of the extraneous segments that are between them have been</span> <span m='828000'>deleted\
  \ from the chromosome. So, this leads me to a second point</span> <span m='833000'>I\
  \ wanted to make, and that is that here we are dealing</span> <span m='838000'>with\
  \ a process of somatic mutation.</span> </p><p><span m='843000'>We talked about\
  \ last time or the time before last the fact that</span> <span m='847000'>somatic\
  \ mutation is generally a process that can lead to cancer,</span> <span m='852000'>i.e.\
  \ the mutation of germ line genes that are in one way or another</span> <span m='857000'>corrupted\
  \ by random mutational processes. But here,</span> <span m='862000'>I'm talking\
  \ about a somatic mutational process,</span> <span m='867000'>which is highly directed\
  \ and highly organized, and focused on creating a</span> <span m='872000'>series\
  \ of rearranged genes that can then serve as the template for the</span> <span m='877000'>production\
  \ of an antibody molecule. So here, let's just look at this</span> <span m='882000'>again.\
  \ Here, I'll tell you, there are many V genes. There are</span> <span m='886000'>many\
  \ D genes, and there are many J genes. And, this is the embryonic</span> <span m='890000'>DNA.\
  \ After large segments of the immunoglobulin locus are deleted,</span> <span m='894000'>and\
  \ then the surviving V, D, and J segments become fused in the DNA</span> <span m='898000'>directly\
  \ to one another. And when that happens,</span> <span m='902000'>the resulting B\
  \ cell DNA can be transcribed, and via splicing create</span> <span m='906000'>an\
  \ mRNA where the region in between the J's chain and the constant</span> <span m='911000'>region\
  \ chain called, here C, is further deleted.</span> </p><p><span m='916000'>So, each\
  \ messenger RNA has one V, one D, and one J segment together</span> <span m='920000'>with\
  \ a constant region segment. There are yet other processes that</span> <span m='925000'>further\
  \ diversify how many different variable regions can be encoded.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='930000'>One of them is the following. It turns out that the process by</span>\
  \ <span m='934000'>which the V and D, and the D and J genes are fused</span> <span\
  \ m='938000'>together, those segments are fused together, is a bit sloppy.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='942000'>And therefore, sometimes the fusion will occur creating\
  \ a sequence of</span> <span m='946000'>nucleotides that has a nonsense codon in.\
  \ Sometimes it will create</span> <span m='950000'>a coherent reading frame that\
  \ creates yet another kind of amino</span> <span m='954000'>acid sequence there.\
  \ And therefore, this is not a highly</span> <span m='958000'>ordered process in\
  \ the sense that these micro-architecture of the</span> <span m='962000'>points\
  \ with the V and the D, and the D and the J are fused is a</span> <span m='966000'>little\
  \ bit chaotic. So that creates even further</span> <span m='970000'>randomization\
  \ of the nucleotide sequence. And then,</span> <span m='976000'>finally, once this\
  \ gene has been created, there is a process which is</span> <span m='981000'>called\
  \ hypermutation, where through mechanisms which are</span> <span m='987000'>not\
  \ well understood, the nucleotide sequence of this</span> <span m='992000'>region\
  \ is actually further changed.</span> </p><p><span m='998000'>It's mutated by certain\
  \ enzymes. For example, there's an enzyme</span> <span m='1004000'>called cytidine\
  \ deaminase, which takes off the amine group off</span> <span m='1010000'>of the\
  \ cytidines in that region, and thereby effectively converts the</span> <span m='1016000'>C's\
  \ in that coding region more into having a T coding capacity.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1022000'>This happens somatically, and here once again I'm talking</span> <span\
  \ m='1026000'>about a further dimension of diversification.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1030000'>One of the dimensions diversification,</span> <span m='1034000'>first\
  \ of all, the V and the J chains rearrange independently,</span> <span m='1038000'>randomly,\
  \ and stochastically. Secondly, the joining of the</span> <span m='1042000'>segments\
  \ is a bit sloppy. And thirdly, there is somatic</span> <span m='1046000'>hypermutation.\
  \ There's an enzyme like this which</span> <span m='1050000'>is actually an actively\
  \ mutagenic enzyme which fiddles around with</span> <span m='1054000'>some of the\
  \ C's in this portion of the gene, thereby further</span> <span m='1058000'>diversifying\
  \ the coding ability of the immunoglobulin gene that's</span> <span m='1062000'>encoded\
  \ by the cell. And what this means is the following,</span> <span m='1066000'>that\
  \ if we imagine this scheme here where each of these B cells</span> <span m='1071000'>recognize\
  \ it's a different antigen, initially there may be 100 million</span> <span m='1076000'>distinct\
  \ B cell clones that are created, each the consequence of a</span> <span m='1081000'>different\
  \ random mutation. That happens early in the</span> <span m='1086000'>development\
  \ of the immune system. Thereafter, there are certain</span> <span m='1090000'>selective\
  \ processes there at play. One important selective process is</span> <span m='1094000'>the\
  \ elimination of B cells that have failed to make nicely rearranged</span> <span\
  \ m='1098000'>antibody molecules. What do I mean by that?</span> </p><p><span m='1103000'>I\
  \ told you how sloppy the V, D, J joining is. And therefore,</span> <span m='1107000'>many\
  \ of these joinings could create reading frames that are incoherent</span> <span\
  \ m='1111000'>with stop codons in the middle. And therefore,</span> <span m='1115000'>those\
  \ cells which happen to have created antibody molecules which are</span> <span m='1119000'>highly\
  \ mutant and clearly structurally defective are</span> <span m='1123000'>eliminated.\
  \ So, one prerequisite for the survival of</span> <span m='1126000'>these B cells\
  \ early in the development of the immune system is</span> <span m='1130000'>that\
  \ they've learned how to make functional heavy and light chains.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1134000'>If they don't, they're right away wiped out. They're eliminated.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1138000'>Here's another very important prerequisite for survival,</span>\
  \ <span m='1142000'>that these B cells don't make antibodies that react with antigens</span>\
  \ <span m='1146000'>that are native to the body's own tissues. What do I mean by\
  \ that?</span> </p><p><span m='1151000'>Well, one of the wonders of the immune system\
  \ is the following,</span> <span m='1155000'>that it can recognize foreign antigens\
  \ that are brought into the</span> <span m='1160000'>body from the outside including,\
  \ for example, the epitopes on the</span> <span m='1164000'>surface of polio virus\
  \ particle. It can recognize many different</span> <span m='1169000'>viruses, surface\
  \ antigens present on the surface of bacteria,</span> <span m='1173000'>and fungi,\
  \ and all kinds of other infectious agents.</span> </p><p><span m='1178000'>But\
  \ importantly, the immune system also sees hundreds</span> <span m='1183000'>of\
  \ millions of different epitopes of the proteins that are present</span> <span m='1188000'>endogenously,\
  \ native proteins in our tissues. A priori,</span> <span m='1193000'>the native\
  \ proteins, what's called our own self-proteins,</span> <span m='1198000'>are perfectly\
  \ qualified to function as antigens.</span> </p><p><span m='1203000'>And yet, the\
  \ immune system rarely develops strong reactivity against</span> <span m='1207000'>them.\
  \ Thus, the immune system has the ability to recognize self versus</span> <span\
  \ m='1212000'>non-self. What do I mean by self versus non-self?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1216000'>Self are the body's own native proteins, which are in principal</span>\
  \ <span m='1221000'>conceivably antigenic. Non-cell are foreign invaders that</span>\
  \ <span m='1225000'>bring strange epitopes into the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>And\
  \ what happens is that B cells, which make antibodies, that</span> <span m='1235000'>recognize\
  \ native proteins in our tissues are, if things are working</span> <span m='1241000'>well,\
  \ rapidly eliminated early in the development of the immune system.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1246000'>What happens if that elimination fails to occur properly?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1252000'>If it fails to occur, one has the process of autoimmune disease.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1258000'>And, there are multiple autoimmune diseases.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1264000'>Type one diabetes, early onset diabetes happens when</span> <span\
  \ m='1268000'>the immune system recognizes antigens that are present in the</span>\
  \ <span m='1272000'>islet cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Rheumatoid arthritis,</span>\
  \ <span m='1276000'>which inflicts a large portion of the elderly, happens when\
  \ the immune</span> <span m='1280000'>system recognizes antigens that are present\
  \ normally in the cartilage in</span> <span m='1284000'>our joints. Lupus happens\
  \ when, it's an autoimmune called lupus</span> <span m='1288000'>which is often\
  \ fatal, happens when the immune system</span> <span m='1292000'>recognizes proteins\
  \ in many different tissues.</span> </p><p><span m='1297000'>And once again, in\
  \ all of these cases,</span> <span m='1301000'>there is a breakdown of the mechanisms\
  \ governing immune</span> <span m='1305000'>tolerance. And what do I mean by tolerance?\
  \ I mean the mechanisms</span> <span m='1309000'>whereby the immune system tolerates\
  \ native antigens,</span> <span m='1313000'>but is conversely intolerant of foreign\
  \ antigens.</span> </p><p><span m='1317000'>The word intolerant is not used in immunology,\
  \ but I'm just using it</span> <span m='1321000'>for the sake of explanation here.\
  \ So, immune tolerance is a very</span> <span m='1326000'>important area of current\
  \ immunological research.</span> </p><p><span m='1330000'>We don't really understand\
  \ why we don't have much more autoimmune</span> <span m='1334000'>disease than we\
  \ do. And by the way, only listed two or</span> <span m='1338000'>three of the most\
  \ common kinds of autoimmune diseases that happen with</span> <span m='1342000'>the\
  \ mechanisms that normally guarantee immune tolerance failed.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1346000'>And therefore, these B cells survive are ones that make</span> <span\
  \ m='1350000'>functional antibodies and those whose antibodies do not recognize</span>\
  \ <span m='1354000'>self-antigens. They are permitted to survive,</span> <span m='1358000'>and\
  \ once again, we imagine that those that happened to make</span> <span m='1363000'>antibodies\
  \ that recognize particular foreign antigens undergo or enjoy</span> <span m='1367000'>clonal\
  \ expansion. During the development of the</span> <span m='1372000'>immune response,\
  \ there is a further diversification</span> <span m='1377000'>of the antigen-recognizing\
  \ domain of the protein by hypermutation.</span> </p><p><span m='1382000'>And therefore,\
  \ descendants of these initially</span> <span m='1386000'>developed cells, which\
  \ have begun to expand because</span> <span m='1391000'>they make an antibody, may\
  \ develop antibody molecules that</span> <span m='1396000'>are even more able to\
  \ bind avidly to the antigen. It could be that</span> <span m='1401000'>initially,\
  \ these antibody-producing cells make antibody molecules that</span> <span m='1405000'>bind\
  \ nicely to the antigen but not really avidly. Avidly means</span> <span m='1410000'>really\
  \ tightly. And, that's enough to get their</span> <span m='1415000'>clonal expansion\
  \ going, but during the process of clonal</span> <span m='1419000'>expansion, this\
  \ hypermutation creates further variants of these</span> <span m='1424000'>cells,\
  \ further mutates their antibody producing genes so that</span> <span m='1428000'>some\
  \ of the descendants of these cells will produce antibody</span> <span m='1433000'>molecules\
  \ that bind even more tightly and specifically to the</span> <span m='1437000'>provoking\
  \ antigen. And when that happens,</span> <span m='1441000'>the quality of the antibodies\
  \ is improved progressively.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>Now clearly, the somatic\
  \ hypermutation once again,</span> <span m='1449000'>it's a random hypermutation.\
  \ And those clones of cells in which</span> <span m='1453000'>the hypermutation\
  \ created less effective antibodies will not have</span> <span m='1456000'>their\
  \ proliferation stimulated. Those clones of cells whose</span> <span m='1460000'>antibodies\
  \ make more and more tightly binding antibodies will</span> <span m='1464000'>preferentially\
  \ have their proliferation stimulated.</span> </p><p><span m='1468000'>And as a\
  \ consequence, they will now be the ones that are</span> <span m='1472000'>favored\
  \ to yield the plasma cells that produce large amounts of</span> <span m='1477000'>antibody\
  \ molecules. So, we have now this very unusual</span> <span m='1482000'>and very\
  \ interesting way by which B cells and plasma cells are able to</span> <span m='1487000'>create\
  \ a wide diversity of antibody molecules. Now,</span> <span m='1492000'>one of the\
  \ interesting things, actually, is the fact that this</span> <span m='1496000'>constant\
  \ region contains one of a variety of distinct</span> <span m='1501000'>constant\
  \ regions. Initially, when one produces the</span> <span m='1506000'>first immune\
  \ response, the first immune response as we said</span> <span m='1510000'>before\
  \ produces a constant region which is called CM,</span> <span m='1515000'>and I\
  \ had the right overhead this morning. Ah, here it is.</span> </p><p><span m='1520000'>Here's\
  \ the way the genes are actually rearranged.</span> </p><p><span m='1524000'>Here's\
  \ the rearranged V, D, and J, and here's the splice to</span> <span m='1529000'>the\
  \ constant region. And downstream are a whole series of</span> <span m='1534000'>constant\
  \ region segments. What's the first one: CM.</span> </p><p><span m='1540000'>I told\
  \ you about that before. Thereafter, C sub delta, C sub</span> <span m='1545000'>gamma-3,\
  \ gamma-1, gamma-2, gamma-8, and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='1551000'>And therefore,\
  \ the initial event can create an ig-mu, an IgM</span> <span m='1557000'>antibody\
  \ molecule. The mu region creates an IgM.</span> </p><p><span m='1562000'>Later,\
  \ as the immune response develops further,</span> <span m='1567000'>this mu segment\
  \ may become deleted. And now, the splice may occur to a</span> <span m='1573000'>delta\
  \ or a gamma change. And therefore, if the intervening</span> <span m='1578000'>constant\
  \ region is changed, you might get what's called an IgG.</span> </p><p><span m='1583000'>An\
  \ IgG is an immunoglobulin which is produced when this</span> <span m='1588000'>antigen-recognizing\
  \ region becomes spliced down to here or here by</span> <span m='1594000'>virtue\
  \ of the deletion of these intervening constant</span> <span m='1599000'>region\
  \ segments. What's the purpose of what's called</span> <span m='1604000'>class switching?\
  \ Because these are different classes</span> <span m='1608000'>of antibodies, because\
  \ they have different</span> <span m='1612000'>functions. Note importantly that\
  \ when this class switching occurs,</span> <span m='1616000'>it has no effect on\
  \ the antigen-recognizing site of the</span> <span m='1620000'>antibody molecule.\
  \ Rather, it affects the constant</span> <span m='1624000'>region of the antibody\
  \ molecule. Well, how does that work? The</span> <span m='1628000'>initially made\
  \ antibody molecule, I told you, is IgM. And in fact, if</span> <span m='1633000'>you\
  \ look at the structure of IgM, it looks like this. Here's, let's</span> <span m='1638000'>say,\
  \ a B cell, and the IgM molecule is actually not</span> <span m='1642000'>secreted\
  \ into the extra cellular space like a soluble</span> <span m='1647000'>antibody\
  \ molecule. Here's what IgM looks like from very</span> <span m='1653000'>schematically\
  \ IgM has our standard antigen-recognizing site,</span> <span m='1659000'>but IgM\
  \ is embedded in the plasma membrane of the B cell exactly the</span> <span m='1665000'>way\
  \ that a growth factor receptor is embedded in the plasma membrane of a</span> <span\
  \ m='1671000'>B cell. But keep in mind that I just said that this IgM molecule has</span>\
  \ <span m='1677000'>an antigen-recognizing domain up here, which is exactly the\
  \ way we</span> <span m='1683000'>described it before. So, the antigen recognition\
  \ is not</span> <span m='1690000'>affected by whether we have an IgM molecule here.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1696000'>Only the location of the antibody molecule, and as I'll\
  \ show shortly,</span> <span m='1702000'>the function of this antibody molecule\
  \ is affected by this IgM.</span> </p><p><span m='1708000'>Later on, descendants\
  \ of this B cell will mature into those that</span> <span m='1714000'>secrete IgG\
  \ molecules into the plasma.</span> </p><p><span m='1720000'>So, here's a maturation\
  \ that's going on. But look here.</span> </p><p><span m='1724000'>Once again, the\
  \ antigen-recognizing domains of this IgG are unaffected</span> <span m='1728000'>by\
  \ this conversion. Here, the constant region is</span> <span m='1733000'>tethering\
  \ the antibody molecule to the plasma membrane.</span> </p><p><span m='1737000'>Here's\
  \ the antigen-recognizing sites.</span> </p><p><span m='1742000'>After this maturation\
  \ occurs, the secreted IgG molecules, which go</span> <span m='1746000'>into the\
  \ solution, have identical antigen-recognizing</span> <span m='1750000'>sites, but\
  \ now they're soluble proteins. Well,</span> <span m='1754000'>you'll say, why does\
  \ the immune system do that?</span> </p><p><span m='1759000'>And, it goes back to\
  \ an overhead I showed you just moments ago in which</span> <span m='1763000'>there\
  \ was a puzzle implicitly created by the image on the overhead.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1767000'>And here it is. Let's look at this for a moment.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1772000'>What detail is now explained in this scheme? What detail is now</span>\
  \ <span m='1777000'>explained? I told you that B cells can be stimulated by certain</span>\
  \ <span m='1783000'>antigens. Let's imagine that each of these B cells made only\
  \ secreted</span> <span m='1788000'>antibody, OK, instead of making cell surface\
  \ antibody because the cell</span> <span m='1793000'>surface antibody, which is\
  \ being made in this scheme,</span> <span m='1799000'>is actually the IgM molecules.\
  \ Let's say this B cell over here is</span> <span m='1804000'>making an antigen.\
  \ I'll just draw it as,</span> <span m='1808000'>there's the antigen, is making\
  \ an antibody against this antigen,</span> <span m='1812000'>and it's secreting\
  \ antibody against this. And I'd just argue that the B</span> <span m='1816000'>cell\
  \ that makes good antibody is favored. It has its proliferation</span> <span m='1821000'>stimulated,\
  \ right? That's what we talked about.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>But if this\
  \ B cell sends all of its antibody into the plasma,</span> <span m='1829000'>how\
  \ is it going to know that it's making a good antibody?</span> </p><p><span m='1834000'>It\
  \ can't because all of the antigen recognition is happening by the</span> <span\
  \ m='1838000'>secreted antibody. So, what happens with the IgM</span> <span m='1843000'>molecules.\
  \ The first antibody molecule this produced is IgM.</span> </p><p><span m='1848000'>And,\
  \ it stays tethered to the plasma membrane of the B cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1852000'>It's\
  \ a transmembrane protein, and it functions much like a</span> <span m='1857000'>growth\
  \ factor receptor. That is to say,</span> <span m='1861000'>when the antigen binds\
  \ out here, there are signals that are radiated</span> <span m='1865000'>into the\
  \ cell that induce the proliferation of this cell.</span> </p><p><span m='1869000'>And\
  \ now, these cells that produce the antigen-recognizing IgM</span> <span m='1873000'>molecules\
  \ on their surface can now have their proliferation stimulated.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1876000'>That solves the puzzle here which is created by this scheme.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1880000'>If all these B cells just made secreted antibody like\
  \ this,</span> <span m='1884000'>then there would be no way to encourage their proliferation</span>\
  \ <span m='1888000'>because there would be no way of telling this B cell you're</span>\
  \ <span m='1892000'>doing a good thing. Keep making more of these antibody</span>\
  \ <span m='1896000'>molecules. Here, the antigen-recognizing capability</span> <span\
  \ m='1900000'>is embedded in the plasma membrane. And when an antigen binds this,\
  \ the</span> <span m='1904000'>IgM molecule's organized so that now growth stimulatory\
  \ signals are sent</span> <span m='1909000'>into the cell which cause this cell\
  \ to begin to proliferate,</span> <span m='1913000'>producing more IgM containing\
  \ cells which are further stimulated</span> <span m='1917000'>to proliferate. And\
  \ ultimately after this has gone</span> <span m='1921000'>on for a while, there\
  \ is a class switching which</span> <span m='1925000'>deletes the IgM region of\
  \ the gene chain region, and causes a</span> <span m='1929000'>conversion to IgG.\
  \ Again, the conversion from here to</span> <span m='1933000'>here doesn't change\
  \ the antigen-recognizing capability of</span> <span m='1937000'>these two antibodies.\
  \ It just makes a cell surface</span> <span m='1941000'>transmembrane protein or\
  \ a secreted protein. (pause)</span> <span m='1945000'>No, the VDJ choice happens\
  \ in the</span> <span m='1957000'>nucleus. It's a fusion of different DNA segments,\
  \ and when it's</span> <span m='1961000'>transcribed, that fused VDJ is now spliced\
  \ to a constant region segment.</span> </p><p><span m='1966000'>The choice of VDJ\
  \ is a fusion of DNA segments. It happens in</span> <span m='1970000'>chromosomal\
  \ DNA. It results in the deletion of all</span> <span m='1975000'>the segments that\
  \ aren't used. So, all that's left in the</span> <span m='1979000'>immunoglobulin\
  \ locus of a B cell is a DNA segment encoding V fused to a</span> <span m='1984000'>DNA\
  \ segment encoding D, fused to a DNA segment encoding J.</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>So\
  \ now, you have a new somatically mutated immunoglobulin gene,</span> <span m='1993000'>lest\
  \ there be any residual confusion about that. So,</span> <span m='1998000'>you see\
  \ the elegance of this class-switching thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2002000'>Now\
  \ there's yet other constant region segments that are used for</span> <span m='2007000'>other\
  \ purposes. For example, when you have</span> <span m='2011000'>allergies, there's\
  \ an activation of the igE antibodies.</span> </p><p><span m='2016000'>When you\
  \ have secreted antibody production in the colon,</span> <span m='2021000'>igA is\
  \ used more for that. So, different ones of these</span> <span m='2026000'>constant\
  \ regions are used for different immunological applications.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2031000'>The IgM molecule, as I've said, is used here just as a</span> <span\
  \ m='2037000'>way of telling the B cell that it's done well by making the right\
  \ kind</span> <span m='2042000'>of antigen-recognizing site. The real business of\
  \ creating</span> <span m='2047000'>antibodies is the soluble antibody production,\
  \ the immunoglobulins,</span> <span m='2051000'>or the gammaglobulins because the\
  \ vast majority of antibodies floating</span> <span m='2055000'>around the blood\
  \ plasma are in fact IgGs. The IgMs are,</span> <span m='2060000'>as implied by\
  \ this, actually just largely tethered to the surface of</span> <span m='2064000'>cells.\
  \ So, this really is an extraordinary,</span> <span m='2069000'>elegant way of creating\
  \ essentially hundreds of millions of different</span> <span m='2073000'>antigen-recognizing\
  \ domains each created collaboratively between a</span> <span m='2077000'>heavy\
  \ and a light chain. And once these antigen-recognizing</span> <span m='2082000'>domains\
  \ are created through changes in DNA structure,</span> <span m='2086000'>then they\
  \ can be used for different immunological applications,</span> <span m='2090000'>driving\
  \ B cell proliferation, secreting soluble antibodies that</span> <span m='2095000'>are\
  \ used to neutralize virus particles in the blood,</span> <span m='2099000'>or if\
  \ they're hyperactive to create allergic reactions or to create</span> <span m='2103000'>immunity\
  \ in certain regions of the gut and so forth.</span> </p><p><span m='2108000'>So,\
  \ this class switching doesn't change the antigen-recognizing</span> <span m='2112000'>capability.\
  \ It just changes the utilization of how already-developed</span> <span m='2117000'>VDJ\
  \ segments and their antigen-recognizing capability are</span> <span m='2121000'>exploited\
  \ by cells of the immune system.</span> </p><p><span m='2126000'>Now, one thing\
  \ that's not really clear by all this is how all this</span> <span m='2130000'>develops\
  \ at the cellular level because what I've talked about until</span> <span m='2135000'>now\
  \ is called humeral immunity. Well, we talk about somebody having</span> <span m='2140000'>a\
  \ good sense of humor. But the actual original meaning of</span> <span m='2144000'>the\
  \ word humor in Latin was fluids that were fluxing through your body,</span> <span\
  \ m='2149000'>and were responsible for your different mood states.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2154000'>So, if you were depressed or there just was a national election,</span>\
  \ <span m='2158000'>there would be black fluids, black humors coursing through</span>\
  \ <span m='2163000'>your blood. And if you were in a good mood,</span> <span m='2168000'>there\
  \ were other humors coursing through your blood.</span> </p><p><span m='2173000'>And\
  \ that leads through this etymology to the term of humeral</span> <span m='2179000'>immunity,\
  \ which is to say the soluble immunity,</span> <span m='2184000'>i.e. the production\
  \ of soluble antibody molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='2189000'>But I will tell\
  \ you that there's a second arm of the immune system</span> <span m='2194000'>which\
  \ is equally important, and that's called cellular immunity.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2200000'>And, to make a long story short, and we'll elaborate it on Monday</span>\
  \ <span m='2204000'>briefly. Cellular immunity is largely created when you have\
  \ a kind</span> <span m='2208000'>of immune cell that's called a cell rather than\
  \ the B cells we've been</span> <span m='2212000'>talking about until now, which\
  \ is able, and this cellular</span> <span m='2216000'>immunity is among other things,\
  \ cytotoxic.</span> </p><p><span m='2221000'>And, it can recognize a second cell\
  \ over here. Here's a second cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2227000'>This is its target\
  \ cell because the second target cell is displaying on</span> <span m='2233000'>its\
  \ surface certain antigens. So, antigens are being displayed on</span> <span m='2240000'>the\
  \ surface of the target cell. I've indicated them here as just</span> <span m='2246000'>little,\
  \ blue strokes. And the T cell is able to recognize</span> <span m='2252000'>these\
  \ antigens on the surface of this cell here,</span> <span m='2256000'>and is able\
  \ to kill this cell through a series of interesting</span> <span m='2261000'>mechanisms.\
  \ This doesn't involve the intervention of soluble antibody</span> <span m='2265000'>molecules.\
  \ Here, we're talking about one cell</span> <span m='2270000'>recognizing another,\
  \ and it turns out to be very</span> <span m='2275000'>important for antiviral defenses.\
  \ I've told you one way by which</span> <span m='2279000'>antiviral defenses are\
  \ achieved. Soluble antibody molecules are</span> <span m='2283000'>secreted into\
  \ the blood plasma like IgGs. They recognize an epitope on</span> <span m='2287000'>the\
  \ surface of a virus particle. They glom onto that epitope on the</span> <span m='2291000'>surface\
  \ of the virus particle, and they neutralize the virus</span> <span m='2295000'>particle.\
  \ And, that's very important.</span> </p><p><span m='2299000'>We started out in\
  \ our discussion of poliovirus talking about that.</span> </p><p><span m='2303000'>But\
  \ this also turns out to be very important. Why is it important?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2307000'>For the following reason: when this cell, let's say this cell is</span>\
  \ <span m='2311000'>infected by poliovirus on the inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2315000'>It\
  \ turns out, interestingly enough, that the cell has a way which we'll</span> <span\
  \ m='2319000'>discuss of processing poliovirus polypeptides, viral polypeptides,</span>\
  \ <span m='2324000'>and displaying them on the cell surface. In other words,</span>\
  \ <span m='2328000'>the cell can chew up some poliovirus proteins, put them to the\
  \ outside,</span> <span m='2333000'>and tell the outside world, these are the kinds\
  \ of the proteins that</span> <span m='2337000'>are being made right now inside\
  \ of me.</span> </p><p><span m='2342000'>You the immune system can't really look\
  \ through the plasma membrane so</span> <span m='2346000'>I'm going to tell you\
  \ this is what's going on inside of me.</span> </p><p><span m='2350000'>There are\
  \ poliovirus proteins being made as we speak.</span> </p><p><span m='2354000'>On\
  \ the outside of the cell, these are displayed even though</span> <span m='2358000'>poliovirus\
  \ replication is recurring exclusively inside the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2362000'>A\
  \ cytotoxic T cell here may recognize these antigens on the</span> <span m='2366000'>surface\
  \ of the poliovirus infected cell, and proceed to kill the cell.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2370000'>Why is that interesting or important? Because the cytotoxic cell will</span>\
  \ <span m='2374000'>kill the virus-infected cell while the virus infection is still\
  \ in full</span> <span m='2379000'>swing. And therefore, by killing the virus-infected\
  \ cell,</span> <span m='2383000'>it will abort the entire bioreplication cycle because\
  \ the</span> <span m='2388000'>virus won't have enough time to replicate or proliferate\
  \ inside the</span> <span m='2393000'>infected cell before it happens. It's preemptively\
  \ killed by the</span> <span m='2397000'>cytotoxic T cell. And in fact, this way\
  \ of eliminating</span> <span m='2402000'>viral infections from our body is as important\
  \ and often more important</span> <span m='2408000'>than the neutralization of soluble\
  \ virus particles in our plasma.</span> </p><p><span m='2413000'>And all that gets\
  \ now to have us focus increasingly on the mechanisms</span> <span m='2418000'>by\
  \ which antigens are recognized and processed so that the immune system</span> <span\
  \ m='2424000'>can begin to respond to them. So, I want to get into that now,</span>\
  \ <span m='2429000'>into the aspects in which we look at the cellular arms of</span>\
  \ <span m='2435000'>the immune system. The most important thing initially</span>\
  \ <span m='2441000'>in the immune response is that let's say poliovirus particle\
  \ is</span> <span m='2447000'>recognized and digested by certain phagocytic cells\
  \ of the immune</span> <span m='2454000'>system. What's a phagocytic cell: a cell\
  \ that is able to gobble</span> <span m='2460000'>up other things. So, a well-known\
  \ phagocytic cell is</span> <span m='2466000'>a macrophage. And there you can see\
  \ the term phagocyte,</span> <span m='2470000'>macrophage. Phagos means to chew\
  \ up or to swallow,</span> <span m='2474000'>so macrophage might see a particle\
  \ like this surround that particle,</span> <span m='2479000'>and then internalize\
  \ that particle and digest it,</span> <span m='2483000'>let's say a poliovirus particle.\
  \ Macrophage could envelop a</span> <span m='2487000'>poliovirus particle and internalize\
  \ it.</span> </p><p><span m='2492000'>It could do the same thing with a bacteria.\
  \ Here,</span> <span m='2496000'>we'll use as an abbreviation for macrophage this.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2500000'>So, that's macrophage. There are yet other even more</span>\
  \ <span m='2504000'>important phagocytic cells of the immune system that are called</span>\
  \ <span m='2508000'>dendritic cells. Now, these cells gobble up whatever</span>\
  \ <span m='2512000'>happens to be around them. They don't care.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2517000'>They are promiscuous sewer, gutter trollers. Whatever happens</span>\
  \ <span m='2522000'>to be around, they will gobble up whatever happens to be around.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2528000'>They'll put it inside of them, and now they do something\
  \ really</span> <span m='2534000'>interesting. The dendritic cells, the macrophages,\
  \ the phagocytic</span> <span m='2539000'>cells, they don't digest the internalized\
  \ particles down to amino</span> <span m='2545000'>acids. They digest the virus\
  \ particle down to oligopeptides.</span> </p><p><span m='2551000'>Usually if 10,\
  \ 12, 14 amino acids long: very important.</span> </p><p><span m='2557000'>So they\
  \ don't make amino acids. They make oligopeptides. Why are</span> <span m='2563000'>they\
  \ doing this digestion? Because these cells are</span> <span m='2569000'>exhibitionists\
  \ and they want to show the rest of the world what they've</span> <span m='2575000'>just\
  \ swallowed up. It's really important to them.</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>Go\
  \ figure. So, what do they do?</span> </p><p><span m='2587000'>They take these oligopeptides\
  \ that they've just internalized and they</span> <span m='2592000'>put them on the\
  \ cell surface via molecules which are called MHC class</span> <span m='2597000'>2.\
  \ MHC class 2 is the name of these molecules, and these are cell</span> <span m='2603000'>surface\
  \ receptors. And, these MHT C class 2 molecules</span> <span m='2609000'>have included\
  \ in them an oligopeptide that has just been</span> <span m='2615000'>produced by\
  \ the proteolytic cleavage of an internalized infectious agent,</span> <span m='2621000'>let's\
  \ say. And so, the macrophage has many of these MHC class 2</span> <span m='2627000'>molecules\
  \ on its surface, and it displays to the outside world</span> <span m='2633000'>what\
  \ it has just captured in terms of these oligopeptides.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>And\
  \ these oligopeptides are, by the way, roughly the size of an</span> <span m='2645000'>epitope.\
  \ Therefore, this macrophage is just so excited.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>It's\
  \ like a little kid who has just found something,</span> <span m='2656000'>so excited\
  \ to show the world what it's just found and gobbled up and</span> <span m='2661000'>processed.\
  \ And over here is a class of cells which are called T helper</span> <span m='2666000'>cells.\
  \ And the T helper cells are interesting in their</span> <span m='2672000'>own right,\
  \ right? The T helper cells have evolved</span> <span m='2678000'>through a mechanism\
  \ that is similar to and parallel to the evolution of</span> <span m='2685000'>the\
  \ B cells. As a consequence, there are many different kinds of T</span> <span m='2692000'>helper\
  \ cells. Each one, so TH-1, TH-2, TH-3, each of which</span> <span m='2699000'>displays\
  \ on its surface a T cell receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='2707000'>What kind of\
  \ T cell receptor does it display? A T cell receptor that has</span> <span m='2712000'>gone\
  \ through exactly the same kind of hoops that the antibody genes</span> <span m='2718000'>have\
  \ gone through. That is, each T cell expresses on</span> <span m='2724000'>its surface\
  \ an antigen-recognizing receptor just like the IgM molecule</span> <span m='2730000'>except\
  \ it's made by T cells and it's created by these stochastic</span> <span m='2736000'>processes\
  \ of fusing DNA segments. So, each of these T cells,</span> <span m='2741000'>and\
  \ again, there are millions of them, has a different T cell</span> <span m='2745000'>receptor\
  \ with a different antigen-recognizing capability.</span> </p><p><span m='2749000'>And\
  \ here's what happens in the immune system.</span> </p><p><span m='2754000'>Let's\
  \ imagine, as I say every year,</span> <span m='2758000'>that we're in a Middle\
  \ Eastern bazaar, and that Middle Eastern</span> <span m='2763000'>bazaar, here\
  \ are all the shops on the sides on the sides of this long</span> <span m='2767000'>bazaar.\
  \ It's sometimes called a shuk or a suk.</span> </p><p><span m='2772000'>And here\
  \ we're going to have a macrophage or a dendritic cell</span> <span m='2776000'>moving\
  \ through the bazaar. Hanging out in front of the stores</span> <span m='2780000'>are\
  \ a whole bunch of T helper cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2784000'>Business is slow,</span>\
  \ <span m='2796000'>so all these T helper cells are just hanging out in front,</span>\
  \ <span m='2800000'>and as is not the custom in this region, let's pretend all the\
  \ T</span> <span m='2804000'>helper cells are girls just for the heck of it. It\
  \ doesn't make any</span> <span m='2808000'>difference. And each of these T helper\
  \ cells is displaying its own T</span> <span m='2812000'>cell receptor which has\
  \ arisen through stochastic mechanisms and</span> <span m='2816000'>which recognizes\
  \ a different oligopeptide.</span> </p><p><span m='2820000'>And here we have now\
  \ the macrophage coming through like a vendor,</span> <span m='2824000'>a street\
  \ vendor, saying, look girls, look at the epitope I just gobbled</span> <span m='2829000'>up\
  \ and produced. Isn't it great? And,</span> <span m='2833000'>it's using its MHC\
  \ class 2 molecules to present, it's like hands,</span> <span m='2838000'>presenting\
  \ the epitopes. It's flogging them like a street vendor,</span> <span m='2842000'>and\
  \ it walks down through this bazaar, and each of the T helper</span> <span m='2847000'>cells,\
  \ they're congregating along the sides of the road,</span> <span m='2851000'>and\
  \ most of them say look at this drip.</span> </p><p><span m='2856000'>Look at the\
  \ garbage he's selling us today. I am totally uninterested.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2860000'>He was here last week with some other chump too.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2864000'>Let's hope he disappears quickly. And meanwhile the macrophage or\
  \ the</span> <span m='2868000'>dendritic cell is very anxiously trying to find someone\
  \ who has even</span> <span m='2872000'>the slightest bit of affection or respect\
  \ for him.</span> </p><p><span m='2876000'>And this goes on for a long time.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2880000'>And finally, the macrophage finds a T helper cell over\
  \ here.</span> </p><p><span m='2886000'>So, here's the T helper cell, and it turns\
  \ out that by coincidence</span> <span m='2893000'>the T helper cell has on here\
  \ surface a T cell receptor that</span> <span m='2899000'>recognizes the epitope\
  \ that the macrophage is peddling.</span> </p><p><span m='2906000'>So, here's the\
  \ macrophage. Macrophage has on its surface this</span> <span m='2914000'>oligopeptide\
  \ held by the MHC class 2 hands. So, here's the peptide.</span> </p><p><span m='2922000'>And\
  \ this T cell receptor which I'll abbreviate TCR recognizes,</span> <span m='2931000'>binds\
  \ strongly to the epitope that's being flogged by the macrophage.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2940000'>And this is, I will tell you honestly, love at first sight.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2944000'>She says, oh, I can't believe it. You're selling an epitope\
  \ that I</span> <span m='2948000'>just happen to love. This is very exciting.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2952000'>And all the other T helper cells say, oh my God,</span>\
  \ <span m='2957000'>what does she see in him? And she gets all excited because</span>\
  \ <span m='2961000'>there's a direct complementarity. In fact, to tell the truth,\
  \ the T</span> <span m='2965000'>cell receptor recognizes not only the epitope but\
  \ also the surrounding</span> <span m='2969000'>amino acids in the fingers of the\
  \ MHC class 2 molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2974000'>It's this constellation\
  \ of things that's recognized by the T cell</span> <span m='2978000'>receptor and\
  \ gets this T cell receptor really excited.</span> </p><p><span m='2983000'>And\
  \ what does she do? Well, we can't talk about everything</span> <span m='2987000'>because\
  \ this is polite company. But most important for what she</span> <span m='2992000'>does\
  \ is she begins to proliferate like mad. Well,</span> <span m='2996000'>you know,\
  \ cells have a limited repertoire of behavioral routines.</span> </p><p><span m='3001000'>Next\
  \ time we're going to figure out how this leads to an immune response.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='3005000'>So, we're going to be on [intention? all weekend.</span> </p>"
