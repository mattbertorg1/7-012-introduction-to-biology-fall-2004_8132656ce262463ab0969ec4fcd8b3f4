transcript: '<p><span m=''1000''>OK, so what I''d like to do today is pick up where
  we left</span> <span m=''6000''>off last time,</span> <span m=''12000''>with respect
  to how this genetic material actually functions.</span> </p><p><span m=''16000''>We
  discussed last time the</span> <span m=''20000''>experiments that identified DNA
  as the fundamental genetic material,</span> <span m=''25000''>the transforming principle.
  We identified the eventual work</span> <span m=''30000''>by Crick and Watson''s
  work at the structure of DNA as a double helix.</span> </p><p><span m=''33000''>We
  mentioned why that was so tremendously important,</span> <span m=''37000''>because
  it contained within it in principle the secret of replication,</span> <span m=''41000''>namely
  two strands, each of which contained the full information,</span> <span m=''45000''>and
  therefore each of which included in principal serve as a template for</span> <span
  m=''48000''>making the other strand. And that is, after all, the big</span> <span
  m=''52000''>issue about life is how do you, in fact, copy life? And then, I</span>
  <span m=''56000''>mentioned briefly these experiments</span> <span m=''60000''>by
  these post-docs, Matt Meselson and Frank Stahl about</span> <span m=''64000''>50
  years ago to demonstrate that the semi-conservative model of DNA</span> <span m=''69000''>replication
  was right by virtue of actually labeling DNA during the</span> <span m=''73000''>course
  of its replication in one generation, and demonstrating that</span> <span m=''78000''>DNA
  actually changed in its density when you added in an isotope of</span> <span m=''82000''>nitrogen.
  And, it changed in its density in such a</span> <span m=''87000''>way as to be intermediate
  between what you''d expect from heavy,</span> <span m=''91000''>heavy, light, light.
  You have the intermediate.</span> </p><p><span m=''95000''>So, that was all good
  experimental confirmation that this model was</span> <span m=''98000''>probably
  right. But now, how does it really work?</span> </p><p><span m=''101000''>After
  all the excitement calms down for a moment you say,</span> <span m=''104000''>OK,
  that''s great. We now know in principal it''s there,</span> <span m=''107000''>but
  what actually goes on? How is DNA really replicated?</span> </p><p><span m=''110000''>How
  is it really read out into information? How does it really,</span> <span m=''113000''>as
  Archibald Garrett noted, and as Beadle and Tatum noted,</span> <span m=''116000''>how
  does it really make protein as well?</span> </p><p><span m=''120000''>How does it
  encode the instructions for that? Well,</span> <span m=''125000''>that was what
  was on people''s minds in the late ''50s.</span> </p><p><span m=''130000''>And,
  it was Francis Crick who was the real intellectual thinker about</span> <span m=''135000''>this.
  And, the eventual synthesis that you guys all know,</span> <span m=''140000''>because,
  again, all this stuff gets taught in elementary school these</span> <span m=''145000''>days,
  was encapsulated in the central dogma of molecular biology,</span> <span m=''150000''>which
  I will summarize here diagrammatically.</span> </p><p><span m=''156000''>The DNA
  is replicated to make copies of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m=''163000''>It''s read
  out into the intermediate RNA, and then it is translated into</span> <span m=''169000''>protein.
  This process: translation. This process is called</span> <span m=''176000''>transcription.
  And this process: replication.</span> </p><p><span m=''181000''>And what I''d like
  to do is go into some detail today about how each of</span> <span m=''184000''>these
  processes work. Now, at the beginning,</span> <span m=''187000''>when people were
  trying to patch this together,</span> <span m=''191000''>it wasn''t as obvious as
  it is to you today, that DNA goes to RNA,</span> <span m=''194000''>goes to protein.
  And, in fact, it was a real struggle to figure out</span> <span m=''197000''>what
  this RNA stuff was doing in the middle, how it could possibly give</span> <span
  m=''200000''>rise to protein. I want to talk about some of that.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''203000''>Let me briefly mention, though, Francis Crick''s term,</span> <span
  m=''206000''>the central dogma, because it sometimes</span> <span m=''210000''>gets
  criticized, the word dogma there as being like</span> <span m=''213000''>religious
  belief and molecular biologists treated in this way.</span> </p><p><span m=''217000''>I''ve
  read a couple of social scientists who sort of say,</span> <span m=''221000''>dogma.
  In fact, Francis Crick deliberately named this the central</span> <span m=''225000''>dogma
  because he said there was no proof for it at the time it was put</span> <span m=''228000''>forward.
  He put it forward with that word precisely to emphasize</span> <span m=''232000''>that
  this was a working guess. But, it was merely a matter of</span> <span m=''236000''>belief
  that this is sort of how they were putting together the pieces.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''240000''>And it was really a question of demonstrating how all these pieces</span>
  <span m=''244000''>work. We still call it the central dogma, but it''s now,</span>
  <span m=''248000''>of course, extraordinarily well established. Let''s look at this</span>
  <span m=''252000''>first piece. DNA is replicated. All right, so Meselson and Stahl</span>
  <span m=''256000''>tell us that, yeah, the DNA weight look like the new</span> <span
  m=''260000''>strand, the old strand, all that. How would you really</span> <span
  m=''264000''>demonstrate DNA replication? If you wanted to show me that DNA</span>
  <span m=''268000''>replication really happens, this DNA goes to DNA,</span> <span
  m=''272000''>that somehow we had to take a double strand of DNA,</span> <span m=''278000''>and
  it gives rise to, it''s one thing to show this in a</span> <span m=''283000''>bacterium
  by adding the nitrogen and all that. The way to really prove</span> <span m=''289000''>this
  was to be in a test tube. In vitro, reconstitute for me DNA</span> <span m=''294000''>replication.
  Show me that in a cell free system,</span> <span m=''300000''>you can take DNA,
  and you can copy it as you would</span> <span m=''305000''>expect according to the
  Crick Watson model here. Well,</span> <span m=''310000''>that is what Arthur Kornberg
  set out to do. Arthur Kornberg was a</span> <span m=''315000''>biochemist, and so
  his interest was crack open the cell,</span> <span m=''320000''>and purify an enzyme
  that was able to copy DNA. Now,</span> <span m=''325000''>how do you do that? What
  cells should you pick?</span> </p><p><span m=''330000''>Sorry? Why E coli? What
  a bacteria? It''s simple,</span> <span m=''333000''>exactly. Good answer. You can
  grow up a lot of it,</span> <span m=''337000''>and presumably, if this DNA replication
  thing is right,</span> <span m=''341000''>it will apply to any organism. So, we''ll
  go with E coli. So,</span> <span m=''345000''>what do you do? You just crack open
  a cell and purify components,</span> <span m=''349000''>and throw them in a test
  tube, and look for DNA synthesis? Well,</span> <span m=''353000''>you''ve got to
  put something in the test tube. What should we put in</span> <span m=''357000''>the
  test tube? Sorry? Nucleotides, because we think that</span> <span m=''362000''>this
  is going to be made out of nucleotides. So,</span> <span m=''368000''>we''d better
  add some nucleotides to our test tube.</span> </p><p><span m=''374000''>So, actually,
  deoxynucleotides, we''ll add some DATP, DCTP, DGTP, and</span> <span m=''380000''>DTTP,
  the deoxynucleotide triphosphates, altogether</span> <span m=''386000''>known as
  the DNTPs. OK, that''s good.</span> </p><p><span m=''393000''>So, we''re going to
  take different fractions of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m=''399000''>We''ll add
  it here. We''ll add some nucleotides, and what else should we</span> <span m=''405000''>add?
  Well, if we were going to copy DNA, maybe we ought to put in a DNA</span> <span
  m=''411000''>strand. Let''s put in a DNA template. So, let''s put in a template</span>
  <span m=''417000''>strand of DNA that we''ll copy,</span> <span m=''422000''>here
  we go, and we''ve got our nucleotides floating around here.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''427000''>And, here''s our template strand, a single strand of DNA,</span> <span
  m=''432000''>and now we add enzymes, and we hope that it''s going to</span> <span
  m=''437000''>somehow copy the DNA. Now, it turns out that that''s a</span> <span
  m=''442000''>little bit optimistic because in order to copy the DNA,</span> <span
  m=''447000''>and I think Kornberg had this insight,</span> <span m=''452000''>it''s
  helpful to give it a start. So, instead of just adding a single</span> <span m=''457000''>template
  strand, he also added a short complementary</span> <span m=''463000''>primer strand
  with the hope that he would be able to purify an enzyme,</span> <span m=''468000''>which
  even if it couldn''t manage to start the synthesis of DNA,</span> <span m=''474000''>would
  be able to extend the synthesis of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m=''480000''>That''s
  a reasonable thing. Let''s not ask for it all at once.</span> </p><p><span m=''484000''>Maybe
  it won''t be a single fraction. Maybe multiple enzymes would be</span> <span m=''488000''>needed
  to get going. So, he needed a primer strand,</span> <span m=''492000''>a template
  strand, and some nucleotides. And then he added</span> <span m=''497000''>fractions,
  and he looked to see whether he could get incorporation</span> <span m=''501000''>of
  DNA. So now, let''s look at this a little more</span> <span m=''505000''>closely.
  The primer strand goes like this. Five prime, ah,</span> <span m=''510000''>This
  direction is going to matter a lot, I told you.</span> </p><p><span m=''515000''>Phosphate
  T, phosphate A, phosphate C, phosphate G, phosphate</span> <span m=''520000''>T,
  phosphate A, stop there. Template strand,</span> <span m=''526000''>the complement
  to that , will start in the opposite direction.</span> </p><p><span m=''531000''>These
  are anti-parallel. What matches the T: A. Keep</span> <span m=''537000''>going:
  T, G, C, A, T, and phosphate,</span> <span m=''543000''>phosphate, phosphate, phosphate,
  phosphate; I''ll stop</span> <span m=''549000''>writing the phosphates in a while.
  Let''s say T, A, G, G, C, etc. This</span> <span m=''555000''>is the five prime
  end. That is the three prime end,</span> <span m=''561000''>OK? And, this one will
  go on further, let''s say.</span> </p><p><span m=''567000''>All right, so what is
  the enzyme that Kornberg hopes to find going to</span> <span m=''572000''>do? What''s
  it going to add to the strand? It''s going to add an A.</span> </p><p><span m=''578000''>All
  right, it wants to put in an A here. So, it''s going to take a</span> <span m=''583000''>triphosphate,
  and it''s going to catalyze the addition of a</span> <span m=''589000''>triphosphate
  to the growing end of this DNA chain,</span> <span m=''594000''>and which is its
  growing end? The three prime end</span> <span m=''600000''>of the chain there, right?
  It''s adding it to the three</span> <span m=''604000''>prime carbon there. And,
  when it does that,</span> <span m=''608000''>where is it going to get the energy
  for catalysis here for this chemical</span> <span m=''612000''>reaction here? It''s
  going to get it from the</span> <span m=''617000''>dehydration synthesis and the
  breaking of this triphosphate bond,</span> <span m=''621000''>which is a high-energy
  bond. You''ll take off your inorganic</span> <span m=''625000''>pyrophosphate and
  you''ll add in an A. That''s it.</span> </p><p><span m=''630000''>Then, it will
  go off and it''ll look for, what, a T,</span> <span m=''634000''>a triphosphate
  with T, DTTP, and then DCTP, etc.</span> </p><p><span m=''638000''>And it adds them
  in. This enzyme, this hypothetical enzyme, that can</span> <span m=''642000''>polymerize
  DNA like that is called polymerase. It''s all very simple</span> <span m=''647000''>stuff.
  This is DNA polymerase. OK, and the nomenclatures here make</span> <span m=''651000''>tremendous
  sense. This is called DNA polymerase.</span> </p><p><span m=''655000''>Anyway, Kornberg
  isolated by a lot of work</span> <span m=''660000''>DNA polymerase, and was able
  to demonstrate that it</span> <span m=''665000''>could in fact catalyze this reaction.
  This was incredibly exciting.</span> </p><p><span m=''670000''>He got a Nobel Prize
  for this amongst other things,</span> <span m=''675000''>but he really demonstrated
  that there were proteins that could copy</span> <span m=''680000''>DNA according
  to this double helical model for replication.</span> </p><p><span m=''685000''>I
  call your attention to the fact that the replication goes</span> <span m=''690000''>five
  prime to three prime always, ever, all the time. This is</span> <span m=''696000''>universal.
  No one has ever found a DNA polymerization system in nature</span> <span m=''702000''>where
  it goes the other way. And, why would that be? This is</span> <span m=''708000''>just
  a digression. But tell me why that would be?</span> </p><p><span m=''714000''>Let''s
  take our strand here, T, G, C, A,</span> <span m=''720000''>T, T, A, G, C, G, T,
  why not go this way?</span> </p><p><span m=''730000''>Why not go, let''s say, A,
  G, C, G. Let''s see, what base should</span> <span m=''740000''>we put in? We''ll
  take our triphosphate T, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''750000''>We''ll put that
  in. Let''s see, where are we going to get</span> <span m=''758000''>the triphosphate
  bond; where are we going to get the energy?</span> </p><p><span m=''762000''>The
  triphosphate''s on the wrong end. Oh, that''s not a problem because</span> <span
  m=''766000''>when we put this G in, it must be that its triphosphate was</span>
  <span m=''771000''>still there, right? So, now we''ll take the next one,</span>
  <span m=''775000''>a triphosphate T, and now why don''t we just</span> <span m=''780000''>carry
  out the polymerization using the triphosphate bond,</span> <span m=''783000''>the
  energy from the triphosphate bond, on a growing chain going in</span> <span m=''786000''>that
  direction? That would work,</span> <span m=''789000''>right? Just stick this guy
  here. It''ll supply a new triphosphate at</span> <span m=''793000''>the end, and
  that triphosphate can be used to catalyze the next monomer.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''796000''>So, what''s the problem? You could put the triphosphates on</span>
  <span m=''799000''>the growing chain. If we went this way,</span> <span m=''803000''>the
  triphosphate bond would be on the growing chain,</span> <span m=''806000''>rather
  than in this way the triphosphate is on the monomer.</span> </p><p><span m=''810000''>But
  who cares? Who might care?</span> </p><p><span m=''815000''>If you were designing
  it, which way would you prefer to do it?</span> </p><p><span m=''820000''>The one
  with the energy first, well, why do you care whether the</span> <span m=''825000''>triphosphate
  is on this big, long chain that you''ve made, or</span> <span m=''831000''>whether
  it''s on this monomer because either way you''ve got a triphosphate</span> <span
  m=''836000''>bond that could be on the monomers floating around,</span> <span m=''841000''>or
  it could be in that last position with the growing chain. Yeah?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''847000''>Could be, could be. What kind of mistake might I make?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''852000''>Yep. And, you know, what other kind of mistakes can happen?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''858000''>What about these high-energy triphosphate bonds: unstable?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''864000''>What if they should just spontaneously hydrolyze?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''870000''>Oops: big trouble, right? You''ve lost your</span> <span
  m=''873000''>triphosphate bond, and but what if this one</span> <span m=''877000''>spontaneously
  hydrolyzes? Aren''t you in trouble? No,</span> <span m=''880000''>get another monomer,
  right? Clearly, it''s no big deal if one of the</span> <span m=''884000''>monomers
  spontaneously hydrolyzes from a triphosphate to a</span> <span m=''888000''>monophosphate,
  but it''s a big deal if you''ve</span> <span m=''891000''>invested all of this energy
  going in the other direction,</span> <span m=''895000''>and it should spontaneously
  hydrolyze.</span> </p><p><span m=''899000''>So, it makes a great deal more sense
  to leave that high-energy bond on</span> <span m=''902000''>the monomer for the
  growing polymer rather than on the polymer itself.</span> </p><p><span m=''906000''>And,
  in fact, of course, nature hasn''t told me why it chose to do</span> <span m=''910000''>this.
  This is my reason why I think nature chose to do this,</span> <span m=''914000''>but
  I think it''s very reasonable, and I think it''s right. So, this is</span> <span
  m=''917000''>not the way it''s done. This is the way it''s done,</span> <span m=''921000''>and
  it''s always done that way. No one has ever found a case where</span> <span m=''925000''>it''s
  not. OK, so now let''s look a little more</span> <span m=''929000''>closely at DNA
  replication. Suppose I take not just this teeny</span> <span m=''934000''>little
  piece that Kornberg gives, but suppose I now look at what''s</span> <span m=''940000''>going
  on in an organism. An organism might have a big,</span> <span m=''947000''>long
  chromosome. DNA replication is occurring along this chromosome.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''953000''>We''ve got to go five prime to three prime, five prime to three prime.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''960000''>Let''s suppose there''s a primer here. Wait a second,
  where''s the primer</span> <span m=''966000''>going to come from? If Kornberg''s
  not there to add the</span> <span m=''972000''>primer, what does the organism do?
  To kind of make one itself, and I''m</span> <span m=''978000''>going to need some
  enzyme to make it. So, what enzyme''s going to make it?</span> </p><p><span m=''984000''>Or,
  primase: it turns out to be remarkably, coincidentally</span> <span m=''990000''>it''s
  primase that makes the primer. It''s funny how that works out. And</span> <span
  m=''995000''>so, primase makes the primer, and then what happens? Then, DNA</span>
  <span m=''1000000''>polymerase comes along and catalyzes the addition, and works
  beautifully.</span> </p><p><span m=''1006000''>What about on the other strand? So,
  it''s got a what?</span> </p><p><span m=''1011000''>Why does it have to play catch-up?
  Let''s see, what kind of primer here?</span> </p><p><span m=''1017000''>It''s got
  to go the other way.</span> </p><p><span m=''1022000''>OK, so let''s get a primer
  here. So, but wait a second, now it</span> <span m=''1026000''>breathes and opens
  up a little more. We''ve got to get a primer here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1030000''>And
  then, when it''s going to open up even more we''ve got to get a primer</span> <span
  m=''1034000''>there. See, this guy''s going the wrong way. So,</span> <span m=''1039000''>in
  fact, this is what happens. When the DNA opens like this, one</span> <span m=''1043000''>primer
  here is sufficient to keep going, but here as you begin to open</span> <span m=''1047000''>this
  up, the other strand needs the continual addition of new</span> <span m=''1052000''>primers,
  and then what happens when this DNA sequence here,</span> <span m=''1056000''>growing,
  meets this DNA sequence there? They''ve got to be ligated</span> <span m=''1060000''>together.
  They''ve got to be joined together. So,</span> <span m=''1064000''>this is actually
  getting kind of complicated. We have little DNA</span> <span m=''1068000''>fragments
  that have to be ligated together on this strand.</span> </p><p><span m=''1072000''>Now,
  how are you going to ligate them together?</span> </p><p><span m=''1076000''>Chemically,
  you''ve got to catalyze a</span> <span m=''1080000''>covalent bond between this
  little growing DNA chain and the previous</span> <span m=''1084000''>growing DNA
  chain that was there. How are you going to ligate them?</span> </p><p><span m=''1088000''>Ligase:
  yes! Coincidentally, it turns out that ligase does that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1092000''>It''s
  just wonderful the way this worked out, that ligase should do</span> <span m=''1096000''>the
  ligation, and primase should do the primer, and all that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1100000''>All
  right, so this goes on and on. Now, this model, which is what</span> <span m=''1104000''>would
  be compelled by what we''re thinking about is experimentally</span> <span m=''1108000''>proven.
  There was a scientist who</span> <span m=''1111000''>demonstrated that on this strand,
  this one goes slower, right, because</span> <span m=''1115000''>it''s got to, just
  as you said, catch up. Playing catch up, this is</span> <span m=''1119000''>what''s
  called the lagging strand. This guy is called the leading</span> <span m=''1123000''>strand.
  The lagging strand plays catch-up to the leading strand.</span> </p><p><span m=''1126000''>And,
  these little fragments can actually be really,</span> <span m=''1130000''>truly
  identified biochemically. They were identified, in fact, by</span> <span m=''1134000''>somebody
  called Okazaki. And, do you know what they''re</span> <span m=''1138000''>called,
  those fragments? Okazaki fragments,</span> <span m=''1142000''>exactly. That''s
  what they''re called. So, that''s how it goes,</span> <span m=''1147000''>and it
  goes with this continuous replication, and then this</span> <span m=''1152000''>discontinuous
  replication there. Now, here''s another problem. This</span> <span m=''1157000''>upset
  people a lot. Try to take a long chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m=''1162000''>In
  fact, let''s even imagine that it''s a circular chromosome like</span> <span m=''1167000''>bacteria
  have, a big DNA circle. Imagine trying to replicate this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1173000''>All
  right, we''re going to pull this apart some. We''ll start replicating</span> <span
  m=''1181000''>as we''ll continue to pull this apart, etc., etc., but the problem
  is that</span> <span m=''1188000''>we''re going to end up with this DNA helix and
  this DNA helix wrapped</span> <span m=''1196000''>around each other so that we''re
  going to have double</span> <span m=''1202000''>helices, or we''re going to have
  interlaced double helices.</span> </p><p><span m=''1207000''>It''s really very messy.
  Topologically,</span> <span m=''1212000''>if I take a double helix and I copy the
  two strands,</span> <span m=''1217000''>and the double helices went around each
  other 800 times before they got</span> <span m=''1222000''>to the end and joined
  up, I''ve now got two circles of DNA that</span> <span m=''1227000''>are inextricably
  linked together with</span> <span m=''1232000''>what''s mathematically called the
  linking number of 800.</span> </p><p><span m=''1236000''>That''s not very good when
  I try to now divide my cell and say,</span> <span m=''1241000''>in one chromosome
  to one cell and one chromosome to the other cell</span> <span m=''1246000''>because
  I''ve got these two long, continuous ropes that are just so</span> <span m=''1250000''>totally
  knotted with each other. This bothered people tremendously.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1255000''>You can prove, mathematically, some of you take the topology courses</span>
  <span m=''1260000''>that there is no way without cutting to pull apart two strings
  that are</span> <span m=''1264000''>so intertwined with each other. So, how in the
  world is life going</span> <span m=''1268000''>to do that? It''s mathematically
  impossible to do that without</span> <span m=''1272000''>actually cutting. So, it
  cuts it because it''s got no</span> <span m=''1277000''>choice, right? There''s
  a theorem that says you</span> <span m=''1281000''>have to cut it. So, it cuts it.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1285000''>You would actually need, it turns out, that if you''re</span>
  <span m=''1290000''>going to separate out these two different double helices that
  are</span> <span m=''1295000''>all wound up around each other, you''re going to
  need to somehow cut</span> <span m=''1300000''>the DNA, separate it, and pass it
  through the other side.</span> </p><p><span m=''1306000''>And, you''re going to
  need to do that to un-knot this thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''1311000''>Now, does
  it change it chemically when you cut it and bring it around</span> <span m=''1317000''>to
  the other side of the string? It''s still the same molecule,</span> <span m=''1321000''>right?
  It''s the same DNA, but topologically it''s different.</span> </p><p><span m=''1325000''>The
  two circles are now not linked to 800 times their links,</span> <span m=''1328000''>799
  times, and if I keep doing that, so they are, you could call them</span> <span m=''1332000''>topoisomers
  because they differ only in their topology,</span> <span m=''1335000''>their topoisomers.
  So, you would need an enzyme that</span> <span m=''1339000''>actually cuts the DNA,
  and is clever enough to pass it to</span> <span m=''1342000''>the other side and
  then seal it back up, and cut the DNA,</span> <span m=''1346000''>and pass it through
  the side and seal it back up.</span> </p><p><span m=''1350000''>What enzyme does
  that? Topoisomerase does that,</span> <span m=''1355000''>that''s right. And, there
  are topoisomerase enzymes that cut and</span> <span m=''1360000''>paste the DNA
  to resolve this terrible linking number problem.</span> </p><p><span m=''1366000''>So,
  life has worked all this stuff out, and there''s just fascinating</span> <span m=''1371000''>work
  that goes on to understand, woops, all of the steps there of DNA</span> <span m=''1377000''>replication.
  Now, I mentioned that these are</span> <span m=''1382000''>actually pretty important
  things because processes like this are very</span> <span m=''1386000''>important
  to rapidly growing cells. It turns out that some very good</span> <span m=''1390000''>anti-cancer
  drugs are inhibitors of topoisomerase because rapidly</span> <span m=''1394000''>growing
  cancer cells are highly sensitive to the need to continue to</span> <span m=''1398000''>topologically
  untangle your DNA. And so, topoisomerase inhibitors</span> <span m=''1402000''>turn
  out to be pretty good, well, they''re not great, but they</span> <span m=''1406000''>turned
  out to be acceptable cancer drugs.</span> </p><p><span m=''1411000''>Here''s another
  issue: fidelity. The fidelity of DNA replication.</span> </p><p><span m=''1418000''>If
  I''m copying the DNA, I''m going to put in my next base.</span> </p><p><span m=''1425000''>It''s
  a T. I want to put in an A, a G, I want to put in a C; how do I</span> <span m=''1432000''>get
  it right? I have my DNA polymerase enzyme here.</span> </p><p><span m=''1440000''>How
  do I manage to get this right? Why don''t I put in a G next to the</span> <span
  m=''1446000''>T instead of an A? Well, it''s energetically less</span> <span m=''1453000''>favored,
  right? Energetically, there''s some cost.</span> </p><p><span m=''1459000''>There''s
  a delta G, an energetic difference between the right base</span> <span m=''1466000''>and
  the wrong base. Now, if I know delta G,</span> <span m=''1472000''>I from biochemistry
  know the equilibrium constant.</span> </p><p><span m=''1478000''>I should be able
  to calculate, based on the energetic difference</span> <span m=''1483000''>between
  putting in the right base and the wrong base how often DNA</span> <span m=''1489000''>polymerase
  makes a mistake, and it turns out you can do that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1494000''>It
  turns out that the equilibrium constant is about 103.</span> </p><p><span m=''1500000''>That
  means that DNA polymerase, remarkably, gets it right 99.9% of</span> <span m=''1510000''>the
  time, it puts it in the right base. Isn''t that impressive?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1520000''>No, it''s terrible. Why is that terrible? Yeah, 99.9%</span> <span
  m=''1530000''>this is no Six Sigma performance or anything. This is pretty</span>
  <span m=''1533000''>unimpressive stuff. I mean, a typical gene is more than</span>
  <span m=''1537000''>1,000 letters. That means we''re going to actually</span> <span
  m=''1541000''>make a mistake on average in every gene. This won''t do.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1545000''>So, what happens? Sorry? Well, clearly the energetics say</span> <span
  m=''1548000''>that the delta G is only enough to get us a factor of 103.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1552000''>We''re going to need an additional mechanism, and the
  additional</span> <span m=''1556000''>mechanism''s a proofreading. It''s absolutely
  right.</span> </p><p><span m=''1560000''>We need to proofread this because we know
  that initially we''re going to</span> <span m=''1564000''>get it wrong at an unacceptably
  high rate. And so,</span> <span m=''1569000''>it turns out that there are two kinds
  of DNA proofreading that go on.</span> </p><p><span m=''1574000''>First off, DNA
  polymerase itself has a proofreading activity.</span> </p><p><span m=''1579000''>Whenever
  DNA polymerase adds a base, it kind of also has an activity that</span> <span m=''1584000''>will
  remove a base. So, it doesn''t just add bases going</span> <span m=''1589000''>forward.
  It also has what''s called an</span> <span m=''1593000''>exonuclease activity that
  removes bases going backwards.</span> </p><p><span m=''1597000''>Now, that may seem
  silly, right, because it''s adding and</span> <span m=''1600000''>subtracting, and
  adding and subtracting, but it adds more than</span> <span m=''1604000''>it subtracts.
  And, the trick is that if there''s a</span> <span m=''1607000''>mismatched base,
  it''s much more likely to subtract</span> <span m=''1611000''>than to add, or much
  more likely to subtract than if there''s not a</span> <span m=''1614000''>mismatched
  base. So, the presence of a mismatch</span> <span m=''1618000''>induces the enzyme
  to do its removal more than if there was a match.</span> </p><p><span m=''1622000''>In
  that fashion, DNA polymerase is able to</span> <span m=''1628000''>substantially
  increase its proofreading ability to about one</span> <span m=''1634000''>error
  in 105 or 106, much better in one in 103.</span> </p><p><span m=''1640000''>Then,
  it turns out that there are mismatched detection and repair</span> <span m=''1646000''>enzymes.
  They come along after DNA polymerase has done its job,</span> <span m=''1652000''>and
  they feel along the DNA for any mismatches. Mismatches are going to</span> <span
  m=''1657000''>create funny structures. They''re going to bulge in some way.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1662000''>And, mismatch repair enzymes are able to detect that
  something''s</span> <span m=''1667000''>funny, and they chop out some sequence,
  and they get copied back</span> <span m=''1672000''>in. Now, with the proofreading
  that comes from these mismatched repair</span> <span m=''1677000''>enzymes, you
  can get down to the neighborhood of one mistake</span> <span m=''1682000''>in about
  108 bases. In the course of the human,</span> <span m=''1687000''>yes? Oh, what
  a great question! Because, when it has a mistake,</span> <span m=''1693000''>how
  does it know who to correct? In bacteria, I can tell you the</span> <span m=''1698000''>answer.
  Wouldn''t it be cool if you could leave a mark on the old strand?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1704000''>If the old strand could be temporarily</span> <span m=''1710000''>marked
  in some way so that the enzyme, when it sees a mismatch,</span> <span m=''1713000''>would
  also know which strand to cut out and re-synthesize?</span> </p><p><span m=''1717000''>It
  turns out that bacteria do that. Methylation enzymes actually mark</span> <span
  m=''1720000''>the old strand. And, it takes a while before those</span> <span m=''1724000''>methylation
  enzymes come along to mark the new strand,</span> <span m=''1727000''>and it leaves
  a temporary mark as to who''s the old strand.</span> </p><p><span m=''1731000''>I
  wasn''t going to mention that today, but it''s a great question.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1734000''>So, it leaves breadcrumbs for a while that tells it who''s</span>
  <span m=''1738000''>the old strand. So, all of this gets worked out.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1742000''>Yes? So, the exonucleases go backwards. They go three prime to</span>
  <span m=''1746000''>five prime because, that''s right, they only work in that</span>
  <span m=''1750000''>direction. There are other exos that go in the other direction,</span>
  <span m=''1754000''>but this exo on the polymerase go backwards, three prime to
  five.</span> </p><p><span m=''1759000''>Now, this is not just theoretical stuff.
  It turns out that about one</span> <span m=''1763000''>person in 400, that is, probably
  at least one</span> <span m=''1767000''>person in this class, is heterozygous for
  a mutation in</span> <span m=''1772000''>one of the mismatch repair enzyme genes.
  One of the genes like MSH-2</span> <span m=''1776000''>or MLH-1 that encode the
  mismatch repair enzymes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1781000''>What do you think happens
  if you are missing one of your two copies</span> <span m=''1786000''>of these mismatch
  repair enzymes? Nothing much. The other copy''s</span> <span m=''1790000''>enough.
  But, what do you think would happen if by chance a single</span> <span m=''1795000''>cell
  in your body were to lose the one remaining working copy of that</span> <span m=''1800000''>enzyme,
  the gene-encoded remaining working copy?</span> </p><p><span m=''1805000''>Then
  it would have no copies. What do you think the response of</span> <span m=''1809000''>the
  cell would be? High mutation rates,</span> <span m=''1813000''>and cancer. It turns
  out that familial, hereditary,</span> <span m=''1817000''>nonpolyposis coli, a familial
  form of colon cancer,</span> <span m=''1821000''>is caused by, in many cases, mutations
  in the gene or genes,</span> <span m=''1825000''>actually, encoding the mismatch
  repair enzymes.</span> </p><p><span m=''1830000''>So, our theoretical understanding
  of the central dogma here is an</span> <span m=''1833000''>incredibly practical
  disease because getting DNA replication right is</span> <span m=''1837000''>important.
  And, that provides a very good proof that</span> <span m=''1840000''>the difference
  between 105 or 106 here and 108 accuracy matters a</span> <span m=''1844000''>great
  deal, that without that mismatch repair enzyme present in</span> <span m=''1848000''>the
  cells, one is in fact going to create new mutations at an</span> <span m=''1851000''>unacceptably
  high rate and lead to cancer. I don''t know,</span> <span m=''1855000''>a few other
  random nice facts about DNA polymerases.</span> </p><p><span m=''1859000''>They''re
  very fast speed. The speed of a DNA polymerase is</span> <span m=''1864000''>about
  2,000 nucleotides per second: very impressive.</span> </p><p><span m=''1869000''>And
  then, one last point I can''t help but mention,</span> <span m=''1874000''>Arthur
  Kornberg discovers this enzyme, shows in a test tube,</span> <span m=''1879000''>it
  works, people work out, how it works in detail,</span> <span m=''1884000''>leading
  strands, lagging strands, topoisomerases, workout</span> <span m=''1890000''>fidelity,
  all these kinds of things, great. But Kornberg''s enzyme, the</span> <span m=''1895000''>enzyme
  he purifies that copies DNA, is it actually the right enzyme? Is</span> <span m=''1900000''>it
  the enzyme that the bacterial cells he used actually use to copy</span> <span m=''1906000''>their
  DNA? Well, a biochemist would say,</span> <span m=''1911000''>I cracked open the
  cell. I purified a component. It''s able</span> <span m=''1917000''>to carry out
  this function. There you go. But,</span> <span m=''1922000''>what would the geneticist
  say? Sorry? Take out the component,</span> <span m=''1926000''>and demonstrate now
  what? That the cell can''t replicate.</span> </p><p><span m=''1931000''>It''s DNA.
  Until you''ve shown that, you haven''t got the other half of</span> <span m=''1936000''>the
  proof. So, of course, some geneticists decided</span> <span m=''1940000''>to put
  this to the test. They took many mutant bacteria.</span> </p><p><span m=''1945000''>One
  at a time, they grew them up,</span> <span m=''1950000''>and they did Kornberg''s
  purification to purify DNA polymerase.</span> </p><p><span m=''1953000''>This is
  unbelievably tedious stuff, guys. You''ve got to take each one.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1957000''>You''ve got to purify it; get DNA polymerase. OK,</span> <span m=''1961000''>it''s
  there. Next one, next one, next one, next one.</span> </p><p><span m=''1965000''>But,
  suppose you found a mutant which couldn''t make Kornberg''s DNA</span> <span m=''1968000''>polymerase
  but still grew and replicated its DNA.</span> </p><p><span m=''1972000''>That would
  prove that Kornberg''s enzyme was not essential.</span> </p><p><span m=''1976000''>They
  did. It turns out that Kornberg''s enzyme,</span> <span m=''1980000''>DNA polymerase
  1, although it can replicate DNA in the</span> <span m=''1984000''>test tube is
  not the enzyme that cells actually use for their major</span> <span m=''1988000''>DNA
  replication. It turns out to be a relatively</span> <span m=''1992000''>more minor
  repair enzyme used to fill in gaps. The actual enzyme is</span> <span m=''1996000''>DNA
  polymerase 3, not that it matters to you a great</span> <span m=''2000000''>deal,
  but this duality between the biochemistry and the genetics is</span> <span m=''2004000''>very
  important because just the biochemical side of the story,</span> <span m=''2008000''>without
  showing that it was essential to the function in the</span> <span m=''2011000''>organism
  misses a very important point there. So,</span> <span m=''2014000''>the combination
  of genetics and biochemistry, biochemistry pointed</span> <span m=''2018000''>us
  to a class of enzymes. The genetics, then, identifies</span> <span m=''2021000''>which
  ones are used for which purposes in vivo,</span> <span m=''2024000''>which is not
  that easy to do in the test tube. Anyway,</span> <span m=''2028000''>I mentioned
  that, and obviously being a geneticist,</span> <span m=''2031000''>I like tweaking
  the biochemists about things like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2034000''>All right,
  onward. So, in our picture of DNA replication,</span> <span m=''2038000''>in our
  picture of the central dogma,</span> <span m=''2044000''>we''ve got DNA goes to
  DNA, and what about the step of transcription,</span> <span m=''2053000''>DNA goes
  to RNA? Well, we''ve got to copy out our DNA into an</span> <span m=''2062000''>intermediate
  molecule called RNA, which is going to then be used as a</span> <span m=''2071000''>template
  for protein synthesis. Where do we start?</span> </p><p><span m=''2078000''>Somewhere
  in here, there''s some information.</span> </p><p><span m=''2083000''>We want to
  make a copy of that information. How do we know where</span> <span m=''2089000''>to
  start? Well, there''s something.</span> </p><p><span m=''2094000''>There''s some
  information that says start here, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2100000''>There''s
  a little sign that says, start here. Such a thing is called</span> <span m=''2106000''>a
  promoter. And, the promoter, which we''ll come and</span> <span m=''2113000''>talk
  about more in a while, probably in a lecture or two,</span> <span m=''2119000''>the
  promoter says here''s the place to start copying the</span> <span m=''2126000''>DNA
  into RNA, and it gets copied into the RNA by an</span> <span m=''2133000''>enzyme
  that starts here, let''s say, I don''t know, T,</span> <span m=''2141000''>A, T,
  G, G, T, A, T. On the other strand I guess it''s going to be A,</span> <span m=''2149000''>T,
  A, C, C, A, T, A. It''s going to start copying here,</span> <span m=''2157000''>and
  it''s going to put in an A. Then opposite the A,</span> <span m=''2164000''>it''s
  going to put in a U, because RNA has U, A, C, C,</span> <span m=''2171000''>A, U,
  A, etc., except this time it''s doing it not out of DNA but out of</span> <span
  m=''2179000''>RNA. How does RNA differ from DNA? So, first off, instead of</span>
  <span m=''2186000''>deoxyribose, this is deoxyribose.</span> </p><p><span m=''2194000''>In
  fact, it''s two prime deoxyribose. This is just plain old ribose.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2202000''>Remember down there on the two prime carbon, DNA had just a</span>
  <span m=''2211000''>hydrogen, whereas RNA has a hydroxyl.</span> </p><p><span m=''2220000''>All
  right, that''s one difference, and it turns out that that hydroxyl</span> <span
  m=''2224000''>is important because it would interfere in making long double</span>
  <span m=''2228000''>helices of RNA. RNA doesn''t make good,</span> <span m=''2232000''>long
  double helices. Let''s entirely do that, oxygen.</span> </p><p><span m=''2236000''>And,
  the other major difference between DNA and RNA?</span> </p><p><span m=''2240000''>The
  only other difference between DNA and RNA is that this has U where</span> <span
  m=''2244000''>this has T, and what''s the difference between T and U?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2249000''>A single methyl group. That''s the only difference between</span>
  <span m=''2258000''>T and U. In this six-member ring over here, there is a methyl
  group.</span> </p><p><span m=''2268000''>And here in the six membered ring, there''s
  no methyl group.</span> </p><p><span m=''2278000''>That''s it. Why does RNA use
  U, and DNA use T? Anybody know?</span> </p><p><span m=''2288000''>It''s not a big
  difference. That would be interesting,</span> <span m=''2292000''>although I don''t
  think it''s true. I actually have no idea. I think</span> <span m=''2296000''>this
  is fascinating. I''ve never had a good accounting of</span> <span m=''2301000''>why
  it uses U and T. You need to know this,</span> <span m=''2305000''>and it''s true,
  but I don''t actually have a,</span> <span m=''2310000''>whereas I have a good explanation
  for this I don''t have a good</span> <span m=''2313000''>explanation for that, although
  maybe some of my Origin of</span> <span m=''2317000''>Life colleagues have an explanation.
  But I''ve always been a little</span> <span m=''2320000''>puzzled. Why does it use
  U instead of T? Anyway,</span> <span m=''2324000''>I do know why it doesn''t have
  the hydroxyl. Well,</span> <span m=''2327000''>it has the hydroxyl there. That really
  does affect the base</span> <span m=''2331000''>stacking, and all sorts of things
  like that. All right,</span> <span m=''2334000''>so you, don''t go away, come back.
  So, the DNA is used as a template</span> <span m=''2338000''>to copy here a strand
  of RNA. Some important names: the strand</span> <span m=''2343000''>that is being
  copied that is being transcribed is called the</span> <span m=''2349000''>transcribed
  strand. This is called the non-transcribed</span> <span m=''2355000''>strand that
  makes good sense. This is also called the coding</span> <span m=''2361000''>strand.
  And, you will find it in your books as the coding strand.</span> </p><p><span m=''2367000''>Why
  is it called the non-coding strand?</span> </p><p><span m=''2374000''>This is called
  the coding strand. Why is the top strand called the</span> <span m=''2379000''>coding
  strand? Because the RNA that I copy out</span> <span m=''2385000''>will have the
  same sequence as the coding strand,</span> <span m=''2391000''>except for T''s and
  U''s. So, the RNA copy that is made from</span> <span m=''2397000''>the transcribed
  strand matches the</span> <span m=''2401000''>sequence of the non-transcribes strand,
  or the coding strand.</span> </p><p><span m=''2405000''>So, you will find this confusing,
  but you will probably find it on</span> <span m=''2409000''>tests and some things
  like that to know which strand you''re looking at.</span> </p><p><span m=''2413000''>The
  coding strand is this strand which has the code that ends up,</span> <span m=''2417000''>but
  in fact it''s the template for the coding strand,</span> <span m=''2421000''>the
  complement to the coding strand, the non-coding strand, the</span> <span m=''2425000''>transcribed
  strand that is copied. Anyway, I''ve said that now, and you</span> <span m=''2429000''>can,
  So, how does it know where to stop?</span> </p><p><span m=''2433000''>Sorry? Stop
  codons. Stop codons are actually about translation into</span> <span m=''2437000''>protein,
  right, because we''re going to come to stop</span> <span m=''2441000''>codons in
  a second. There was some start signal there</span> <span m=''2445000''>called a
  promoter, which is a start of transcription.</span> </p><p><span m=''2449000''>It
  turns out there was also a stop signal that says stop of</span> <span m=''2453000''>transcription.
  And, you guys haven''t probably met</span> <span m=''2457000''>that before. But,
  there''s a start signal,</span> <span m=''2463000''>a stop signal, and all over
  the genome there are these things.</span> </p><p><span m=''2469000''>So, here''s
  some genome. Here''s some gene that''s got to be read out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2475000''>And,
  it''s read out this way, let''s say. This is the coding strand.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2481000''>This is what, I''ll make two strands here. Now, in the next</span>
  <span m=''2487000''>gene over here, does it go in the same direction?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2493000''>It might. Or, it might not. It turns out that the orientation of</span>
  <span m=''2499000''>genes along the chromosome, which way you read, is not a fixed</span>
  <span m=''2505000''>thing across the entire length of the chromosome.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2511000''>So, when I refer to the transcribed strand or the non-transcribed
  strand,</span> <span m=''2517000''>that''s just a local definition that says, with
  respect to that gene,</span> <span m=''2521000''>this strand is coding, and this
  strand is non-coded.</span> </p><p><span m=''2524000''>But with respect to the next
  gene over, it could be the other way.</span> </p><p><span m=''2528000''>Now, this
  is not a very orderly way to do things, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2531000''>If
  a good engineer did this, they''d probably get all the pieces</span> <span m=''2534000''>going
  in line and all that. But life did this, and it turns out</span> <span m=''2538000''>that
  evolvable systems, you know, couldn''t possibly maintain</span> <span m=''2541000''>that
  order. Things are happening all the time, and genes can come in</span> <span m=''2544000''>any
  order. In addition, how does RNA polymerase know when to</span> <span m=''2548000''>turn
  on the gene? Oh, sorry, what''s the enzyme that</span> <span m=''2552000''>polymerizes
  RNA? RNA polymerase, yes.</span> </p><p><span m=''2556000''>How does it know when
  to turn on the gene? How does it turn on the</span> <span m=''2560000''>right genes
  in the right tissues? We''ll come to that. That''s gene</span> <span m=''2564000''>regulation.
  That''s a big non-trivial thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2569000''>We''ll save that
  one. All right, so we have all of this</span> <span m=''2573000''>transcription.
  Let''s now look at the last</span> <span m=''2577000''>important part of our picture
  here, which is translation.</span> </p><p><span m=''2583000''>So, RNA goes to protein.
  So, if RNA goes to protein,</span> <span m=''2591000''>we take our messenger, our
  RNA over there. This is an RNA.</span> </p><p><span m=''2598000''>What''s the direction
  it''s been copied? Five prime</span> <span m=''2606000''>to three prime. It''s a
  single strand of RNA that</span> <span m=''2614000''>we''ve copied here, a single
  strand and molecule,</span> <span m=''2623000''>and let''s give it a sequence, A,
  U, A, C, G, A, U, G, A, A, G, C, C,</span> <span m=''2632000''>C, etc. Eventually
  we''ll get to U, A, G. How is this RNA interpreted?</span> </p><p><span m=''2642000''>Well,
  in an abstract sense, the way this RNA is interpreted is</span> <span m=''2648000''>by
  a triplet code. The cell could come along and start</span> <span m=''2654000''>reading
  three letter codons. But, does it just start anywhere?</span> </p><p><span m=''2660000''>No,
  it always starts at the same codon, and that codon is A,</span> <span m=''2666000''>U,
  G. This is an initiator codon.</span> </p><p><span m=''2672000''>And it encodes
  a methionine. Then, the next codon down encodes</span> <span m=''2680000''>lysine,
  arginine, etc. The interesting challenge is</span> <span m=''2689000''>how in the
  world you get from a sequence of nucleotides to a</span> <span m=''2697000''>sequence
  of amino acids. So, we have to now get this funny</span> <span m=''2705000''>translation
  step between nucleotides and amino acids.</span> </p><p><span m=''2712000''>This
  concerned people greatly because transcription was pretty</span> <span m=''2719000''>easy.
  Transcription was going to be the RNA, actually first</span> <span m=''2726000''>replication,
  each nucleotide would match a</span> <span m=''2732000''>nucleotide on the DNA sequence.
  Then, RNA polymerization, each</span> <span m=''2737000''>nucleotide of RNA would
  match. But how are we going to get amino</span> <span m=''2742000''>acids to match
  specific RNA sequences? How are we going to get</span> <span m=''2747000''>amino
  acids? Now, this bothered people a great deal.</span> </p><p><span m=''2752000''>And,
  you know what some of the ideas were? Well, protenase,</span> <span m=''2757000''>right.
  Some enzyme, well,</span> <span m=''2761000''>actually the first ideas were very
  physical ideas.</span> </p><p><span m=''2765000''>It was that the RNA message there
  would fold up into some kind of a</span> <span m=''2769000''>funny shape that would
  just happen to match a lysine,</span> <span m=''2773000''>and then the next little
  bit would fold up to match,</span> <span m=''2776000''>I don''t know, histidine,
  a methianine, and a serine,</span> <span m=''2780000''>and a this, because people
  were thinking the complementarity of DNA</span> <span m=''2784000''>bases all just
  physical matching that it would work that the</span> <span m=''2788000''>amino acids
  would be directly read off the RNA message.</span> </p><p><span m=''2792000''>But,
  it was kind of crazy to imagine that because the amino acids</span> <span m=''2796000''>all
  have such wildly different physical properties: positive</span> <span m=''2800000''>charges,
  negative charges, hydrophilic, hydrophobic, different</span> <span m=''2804000''>sizes.
  It just didn''t make sense, but it bothered people a great deal.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2808000''>But, I would say that a lot of biochemists thought that that was</span>
  <span m=''2812000''>sort of how it was going to have to work. The guy who really
  figured</span> <span m=''2816000''>out what was going on did it with no experimental
  data whatsoever.</span> </p><p><span m=''2820000''>He did it by just sitting down
  and saying, that doesn''t make any sense.</span> </p><p><span m=''2824000''>There''s
  got to be another solution. And, that was Francis Crick.</span> </p><p><span m=''2828000''>Francis
  Crick just had an incredible mind.</span> </p><p><span m=''2832000''>He, Mendel,
  and a few other people had this incredible insight into</span> <span m=''2836000''>things.
  He said, look, this just makes no sense that</span> <span m=''2840000''>the physical
  properties are going to do it. He said,</span> <span m=''2844000''>what''s got to
  be going on is that what I want to put in</span> <span m=''2848000''>a certain amino
  acid into a growing protein chain,</span> <span m=''2852000''>I''m going to take
  my amino acid here. I''m going to take my codon here,</span> <span m=''2858000''>and
  I''m going to build me some kind of an adapter.</span> </p><p><span m=''2863000''>And,
  this adapter molecule will, in fact, solve the problem. So, he</span> <span m=''2869000''>said,
  because Francis Creek, in addition to being brilliant,</span> <span m=''2874000''>really
  didn''t do any experiments.</span> </p><p><span m=''2880000''>He didn''t do any
  experiments both because he wasn''t that fond of doing</span> <span m=''2884000''>experiments,
  and because he was legendarily not very good at the</span> <span m=''2889000''>bench.
  But, what Francis did was he exhorted all of his colleagues to go</span> <span m=''2893000''>find
  the adapter. He had what he called the adapter</span> <span m=''2898000''>hypothesis.
  And sure enough, Crick was dead on, just right.</span> </p><p><span m=''2903000''>The
  adapter hypothesis turned out to be that there was an</span> <span m=''2907000''>adapter
  molecule who was made itself out of RNA</span> <span m=''2912000''>called transfer
  RNA. And, transfer RNA matched up by</span> <span m=''2918000''>base pairing to
  each codon you see, and had amino acids attached to it</span> <span m=''2924000''>and
  so the problem of how you mediate between a three-letter code</span> <span m=''2930000''>of
  DNA or RNA, of nucleotides,</span> <span m=''2936000''>and amino acids was solved
  by a clever intermediate.</span> </p><p><span m=''2942000''>It turned out that they
  looked, they found the molecule. So, it''s</span> <span m=''2945000''>just one of
  these great examples of somebody having thought up an idea,</span> <span m=''2948000''>sent
  people off to look for it, and it was there. And then,</span> <span m=''2951000''>of
  course, you''ve got to ask, how did the amino acids get stuck</span> <span m=''2954000''>onto
  the right transfer RNAs? And the answer is there''s a bunch</span> <span m=''2957000''>of
  specific enzymes that do precisely that job,</span> <span m=''2960000''>that look
  at the transfer RNA, attach the amino acid, and handle</span> <span m=''2963000''>that
  whole problem. I will next time briefly end with</span> <span m=''2966000''>the
  ribosome, and how those transfer RNAs work to</span> <span m=''2970000''>catalyze
  together the protein chain, and then what I want to do is turn</span> <span m=''2974000''>to
  how this common picture of DNA, RNA, and protein varies amongst</span> <span m=''2979000''>organisms.
  Until next time.</span> </p>'
