title: 'Lecture 20: Cancer'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>So, when I first came to town, the Red Sox hadn't won
  for 42 years.</span> </p><p><span m='4000'>Now it's been 86 years, so the whole
  town all of a sudden changes</span> <span m='8000'>its psychology. A time for great
  celebration,</span> <span m='13000'>at least for you Red Sox fans. At the, after
  last lecture I had an</span> <span m='17000'>interesting conversation with one of
  you. One of you came up to me and</span> <span m='21000'>said very politely, Professor
  Weinberg, do you have some</span> <span m='26000'>lecture notes that you have written
  out what the important points of the</span> <span m='30000'>lecture are that you
  could give me or that you could give us?</span> </p><p><span m='35000'>And I said,
  you know, I, I'm not really interested in</span> <span m='39000'>doing that. And
  the reason I'm not really interested in doing that is</span> <span m='43000'>that
  the main function of this course is to enable you to listen to,</span> <span m='47000'>when
  somebody is talking about conceptually complex things and to</span> <span m='51000'>distil
  what's being said and to figure out in your own mind what's</span> <span m='55000'>important
  and what is just another piece of drivel coming out of my</span> <span m='59000'>mouth
  or Eric Lander's mouth. In fact, speaking for him,</span> <span m='64000'>if I will
  allow, can allow myself, and myself, in the end we don't</span> <span m='68000'>really
  care that much whether you know the difference between DNA and</span> <span m='72000'>RNA
  or proteins and phospholipids. What we're really interested in</span> <span m='76000'>doing
  is to use this course as a vehicle for pushing you to get your</span> <span m='80000'>brains
  functioning even better than they already are.</span> </p><p><span m='84000'>And,
  therefore, if you learn in this course how to,</span> <span m='88000'>to think about
  very complex subjects and figure out what's really going</span> <span m='92000'>on
  then this course will have more than paid for itself in terms of the</span> <span
  m='96000'>energy you put into it. So, that's part of the reason why we</span> <span
  m='101000'>don't provide you with lecture outlines. We want you to figure out</span>
  <span m='106000'>what's important on your own. Being able to do so will itself be</span>
  <span m='111000'>a major triumph. At the end of our discussion last</span> <span
  m='115000'>time we talked about the cell cycle, the fact that it has, has four major</span>
  <span m='120000'>active phases. G1, S, G2 and mitosis.</span> </p><p><span m='125000'>We
  talked about mitosis. And we talked about the fact that</span> <span m='129000'>when
  cells emerge from mitosis, from M phase in the absence of</span> <span m='134000'>growth
  stimulatory factors then they go into G zero.</span> </p><p><span m='138000'>And
  if they're provided with growth stimulatory factors then they'll go</span> <span
  m='143000'>back into the active cell cycle. And this G zero phase we talked</span>
  <span m='147000'>about is a quiescence phase, it's a resting phase.</span> </p><p><span
  m='152000'>In fact, there are two kinds of quiescent cells in our bodies.</span>
  </p><p><span m='156000'>Those that go into quiescence, non-growth reversibly, and
  are able</span> <span m='160000'>to reemerge back into the active cell cycle, and
  those cells which</span> <span m='164000'>have irreversibly retreated from the active
  cell cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='168000'>So, for example, there are many cells
  in our brain where no matter</span> <span m='172000'>what you do to them they will
  never be able to go back into the active</span> <span m='176000'>cell cycle. And
  they are, in that sense, considered to be</span> <span m='180000'>post-mitotic.
  Post-mitotic meaning that they will</span> <span m='184000'>never again grow. It's
  really not clear which of the</span> <span m='189000'>post-mitotic cells, which
  tissues in the body harbor,</span> <span m='193000'>harbor post-mitotic cells. We
  used to think that most of the</span> <span m='198000'>differentiated cells in our
  body are post-mitotic. And when I say</span> <span m='203000'>differentiated, a
  topic we will not get into for the</span> <span m='208000'>moment, what I mean is
  that different cells in different parts</span> <span m='213000'>of the body have
  become differentiated by becoming very</span> <span m='217000'>specialized to become
  neurons or becoming liver cells or to becoming</span> <span m='222000'>skin cells
  and so forth. And it is probably the case that</span> <span m='226000'>there are
  many kinds of differentiated cells in the body</span> <span m='230000'>which once
  they differentiate will no longer enter into the active cell</span> <span m='234000'>cycle.
  Now, getting back to this.</span> </p><p><span m='238000'>As I also mentioned, if
  we look at a Petri dish then and</span> <span m='242000'>we put cells like fibroblast,
  connective tissue cells in the</span> <span m='246000'>bottom of the Petri dish,
  as I told you last time, if you</span> <span m='250000'>provide those cells with
  medium which contains all the requisite</span> <span m='254000'>nutrients, these
  cells will sit here happily for an extended period of</span> <span m='258000'>time
  but will not proliferate. However, if you add to their serum,</span> <span m='262000'>add
  their medium, you add serum to this medium. Serum usually comes</span> <span m='266000'>from
  cows, so therefore it's called bovine serum.</span> </p><p><span m='270000'>Then
  the serum, in addition to the nutrients present</span> <span m='274000'>in the,
  in the medium will indeed provoke these cells to proliferate,</span> <span m='279000'>and
  there are agents in the serum, in fact there are agents which are</span> <span m='283000'>called
  growth factors which are contained within the serum which are</span> <span m='288000'>responsible
  for inducing these, these cells to begin to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='293000'>Well,
  it's instructive just for a moment to step back and ask</span> <span m='297000'>ourselves
  what actually is serum? How do you get serum?</span> </p><p><span m='301000'>And
  the way you get serum is you take blood and you allow it to clot.</span> </p><p><span
  m='305000'>And when blood clots the platelets in the, in the blood,</span> <span
  m='309000'>platelets are small cellular fragments, they have an intact</span> <span
  m='313000'>plasma membrane but they're just, they're very tiny, they don't have
  a</span> <span m='316000'>nucleus, and these A, A nuclear fragments, these platelets,</span>
  <span m='320000'>when blood is induced to clot the platelets aggregate with one
  another</span> <span m='324000'>and you form a big clump, and that, a clot settles
  to the</span> <span m='328000'>bottom of the test-tube. But in the context of wounding,</span>
  <span m='332000'>let's say you make a cut on your skin, what happens is that blood</span>
  <span m='336000'>rushes into the site of, of the, the cut or the wound,</span> <span
  m='340000'>clotting occurs in order to create coagulation. And why is there</span>
  <span m='344000'>coagulation? In order to staunch the bleeding. In order to prevent</span>
  <span m='348000'>there to be further hemorrhage, further loss of blood. But at the</span>
  <span m='352000'>same time, as the platelets are aggregating to help form the</span>
  <span m='356000'>structure of the clot that, that creates a physical barrier to</span>
  <span m='360000'>prevent further bleeding, simultaneously the platelets are</span>
  <span m='364000'>releasing a lot of growth factors into the medium around them.</span>
  </p><p><span m='368000'>Why are they doing that? Because what's happening</span>
  <span m='373000'>simultaneous with stopping the bleeding is that the platelets are,</span>
  <span m='378000'>are releasing growth factors which are used in order to begin to</span>
  <span m='383000'>reconstruct and heal the site of wounding. Consequently,</span>
  <span m='388000'>what happens is that the platelets release growth factors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='393000'>These growth factors stimulate cells right around the sides
  of the wound</span> <span m='397000'>which are still viable and have not been destroyed
  to begin to</span> <span m='402000'>proliferate in order to reconstruct and intact
  tissue.</span> </p><p><span m='406000'>One of the most important of these, of these,
  of these factors that they</span> <span m='411000'>release is platelet-derived growth
  factor. Remember GF is</span> <span m='415000'>just growth factor. And platelet-derived
  growth factor,</span> <span m='420000'>or as it's called in the trade PDGF, I mentioned
  it briefly last time, is</span> <span m='424000'>a very potent mitogen. A mitogen
  is a growth stimulatory</span> <span m='429000'>agent. It's an important mitogen
  for fibroblasts.</span> </p><p><span m='434000'>Fibroblasts, as you recall, are
  the connective tissue, the</span> <span m='438000'>connective tissue cells that
  are found throughout the body.</span> </p><p><span m='443000'>And, therefore, if
  you were to, for example, add platelet-derived</span> <span m='448000'>growth factor,
  PDGF to those fibroblasts that were</span> <span m='452000'>sitting there in G zero,
  PDGF will stimulate the fibroblasts</span> <span m='457000'>to begin to enter into
  the active cell cycle, to exit from G zero,</span> <span m='462000'>to enter into
  G1, and therefore to complete a, a full cell cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='467000'>And,
  by the way, recall what I said before,</span> <span m='471000'>that after the cells
  leave the active, leave G zero and move</span> <span m='475000'>throughout the active
  cell cycle and they have a lot of growth factors,</span> <span m='479000'>they'll
  go all the way around the active growth cycle to mitosis.</span> </p><p><span m='483000'>And
  when they emerge from mitosis, once again they'll ask themselves</span> <span m='487000'>the
  question whether it's a good idea to continue to be in the active</span> <span m='492000'>cell
  cycle or whether they should exit into G zero,</span> <span m='496000'>perhaps doing
  so reversibly. Interestingly, if you look at the</span> <span m='501000'>way that
  the cell cycle is organized then what you see is the following,</span> <span m='505000'>if
  I can draw the cell cycle again. Here's G1.</span> </p><p><span m='510000'>Here's
  S phase. And here's G2. And right at,</span> <span m='514000'>at a distinct point
  toward the end of G1 is something called the</span> <span m='518000'>restriction
  point, which is going to be very</span> <span m='522000'>interesting shortly. And
  what happens is after cells</span> <span m='526000'>emerge from G, from mitosis
  and they move</span> <span m='530000'>throughout the, the most of G1 they're continually</span>
  <span m='534000'>assessing their extracellular environment to determine whether
  or</span> <span m='538000'>not there are enough growth factors around to justify
  their continuing</span> <span m='542000'>the rest of the cell cycle. And ultimately
  they'll reach this</span> <span m='547000'>restriction point, or as it's sometimes
  called the R</span> <span m='551000'>point, and here they will make the final go
  versus no-go decision.</span> </p><p><span m='555000'>So, if there have historically
  been enough growth factors from the</span> <span m='559000'>beginning of G1 all
  the way to the R point then cells will commit</span> <span m='563000'>themselves
  essentially irreversibly to going through the entire rest of</span> <span m='567000'>the
  cell cycle, through M. Conversely, if cells reach up to</span> <span m='571000'>this
  R point and they calculate that there are enough,</span> <span m='575000'>there
  are not enough mitogenic growth factors to justify</span> <span m='579000'>proliferation
  then they'll jump out of the active cell cycle and go back</span> <span m='583000'>to
  G zero. What that means, in effect, is as follows. Once the</span> <span m='586000'>cells
  have passed through the R point and they're over here and they</span> <span m='590000'>are
  committed to complete the rest of the cell cycle then you can take</span> <span
  m='594000'>growth factors out of their medium and they don't care because they</span>
  <span m='598000'>only want to receive these stimulatory signals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='602000'>They only care about in this window of time. Hereafter,</span> <span
  m='606000'>they're committed essentially irreversibly to go through the rest</span>
  <span m='611000'>of the cell cycle. There are, as it turns out,</span> <span m='615000'>also
  growth inhibitory factors. So, here we've been talking about</span> <span m='620000'>mitogens,
  the growth inhibitory factors. So, an important growth</span> <span m='625000'>inhibitory
  factor is, for example, TGF beta.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>And TGF beta works
  exactly opposite to PDGF because it is a single which</span> <span m='634000'>is
  present in extracellular space and tells the cell it should stop</span> <span m='638000'>proliferating.
  And, therefore,</span> <span m='642000'>TGF beta, if it's present in large amounts
  in this part of the cell</span> <span m='647000'>cycle, if the cell experiences
  it in large amounts,</span> <span m='651000'>that will influence the cell not to
  move through the restriction point.</span> </p><p><span m='655000'>Conversely, if
  it's absent then obviously PDGF can have the,</span> <span m='659000'>the undiluted
  tensions of the cell. And, therefore,</span> <span m='664000'>what I'm trying to
  convey by this is to tell you that cell balances both</span> <span m='668000'>its
  growth stimulatory and growth inhibitory signals that it's</span> <span m='672000'>receiving
  from extracellular space, these decisions are weighed, and</span> <span m='676000'>finally
  down here the cell with make the, the binary decision to go ahead</span> <span m='680000'>or
  not to go ahead, depending on historically how many</span> <span m='684000'>of these
  factors its recruited in this specific window of time.</span> </p><p><span m='689000'>Recall,
  as we said last time, that once a growth factor like PDGF</span> <span m='693000'>goes
  to the plasma membrane it encounters a receptor on the surface</span> <span m='697000'>which
  let's say we call the PDGF receptor. And I'll just draw it</span> <span m='702000'>like
  this for the moment. It's a transmembrane protein.</span> </p><p><span m='706000'>The
  extracellular domain is on the outside. And I'm drawing two copies</span> <span
  m='711000'>of the PDGF receptor here for reasons that will become</span> <span m='715000'>apparent
  in a moment. And what happens is that PDGF which,</span> <span m='720000'>for example,
  can be itself a dimer-, it can be a dimeric growth factor.</span> </p><p><span m='724000'>So,
  it has two distinct subunits in it. They're both essentially</span> <span m='729000'>equivalent
  to one another but it is dimeric. And this dimeric structure,</span> <span m='733000'>PDGF,
  allows it to bind to two growth factor receptors</span> <span m='738000'>simultaneously.
  Well, why is that interesting?</span> </p><p><span m='742000'>It's interesting for
  the following reason.</span> </p><p><span m='747000'>These transmembrane PDGF receptors,
  like the ones I've indicated right</span> <span m='751000'>here, they're anchored
  in the plasma membrane because there's a portion</span> <span m='755000'>of their
  sequence right in here in the transmembrane domain,</span> <span m='759000'>I'm
  indicating it here in the orange, which contains highly hydrophobic</span> <span
  m='763000'>amino acids. And those hydrophobic amino acids obviously love to be in</span>
  <span m='767000'>this hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer and their,</span>
  <span m='771000'>by they don't, they have no effect at all on whether the PDGF receptors</span>
  <span m='775000'>can move, can traverse in the plane of the plasma membrane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='780000'>So, the PDGF receptors can move across the face of the plasma</span>
  <span m='783000'>membrane. These ones can move to the right or the left,</span>
  <span m='787000'>but they're not going to come in or out because they're anchored
  in this</span> <span m='790000'>lipid bilayer by this stretch of hydrophobic amino
  acids.</span> </p><p><span m='794000'>Now, what happens interestingly when PDGF,
  the dimeric receptor</span> <span m='797000'>binds to two of these PDGF receptor
  molecules, which,</span> <span m='801000'>as I told you, have lateral freedom to
  translate laterally on the plane</span> <span m='804000'>of a plasma membrane, what
  happens is it will bind two of</span> <span m='808000'>these receptors. And, in
  so doing,</span> <span m='812000'>it will pull the two receptor molecules next to
  one another.</span> </p><p><span m='816000'>Previously, they were just floating
  around in the plane of the plasma</span> <span m='821000'>membrane having bound
  their ligand, recall that PDGF is considered a</span> <span m='826000'>ligand for
  the PDGF receptor, having, it will cause these two</span> <span m='830000'>receptor
  molecules to now become, become pulled very close to one</span> <span m='835000'>another.
  So, I'll redraw it now like this.</span> </p><p><span m='840000'>Now these two receptor
  molecules look like this,</span> <span m='843000'>they're right, they're cheek by
  jowl, they're right next to one another,</span> <span m='847000'>and this has some
  interesting consequences. Of great interest</span> <span m='851000'>here is the
  affect this has on the ability of the PDGF receptor to emit</span> <span m='855000'>signals
  into the cytoplasm. Because recall that the end game</span> <span m='858000'>here
  is always how does the, how does the intracellular part of</span> <span m='862000'>the
  cell know that this, there's been an encounter with the</span> <span m='866000'>growth
  factor in the extracellular space?</span> </p><p><span m='870000'>And this signal-emitting
  power to PDGF receptor comes from the fact</span> <span m='875000'>that once these
  two domains are brought together,</span> <span m='880000'>each of these two domains
  is able to modify the other and change the</span> <span m='885000'>other, i.e.,
  subunit A modifies subunit B, subunit B modifies</span> <span m='890000'>subunit
  A. And how is this modification achieved?</span> </p><p><span m='895000'>For the
  follow, it is achieved in the following way.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>That
  the, this domain, which I've been calling,</span> <span m='904000'>I've just been
  writing like this, as a rectangle, is actually a</span> <span m='908000'>catalytic
  agent. It's actually a tyrosine kinase.</span> </p><p><span m='913000'>So, it's
  an enzyme. And a tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that takes the</span> <span m='917000'>gamma
  phosphate from ATP, the high energy phosphate from APT,</span> <span m='922000'>ATP
  and transfers it to tyrosine amino acids that are present</span> <span m='926000'>on
  substrates. So, if here is an amino acid</span> <span m='931000'>sequence in the
  single letter, letter code, and if we admit that Y</span> <span m='935000'>is the,
  is the code for tyrosine then if here's a protein that it</span> <span m='940000'>functions
  as a substrate for a tyrosine kinase,</span> <span m='944000'>a tyrosine kinase
  will add a phosphate group to the side chain of</span> <span m='948000'>the tyrosine,
  which I'm not drawing here, but tyrosine has a hydroxyl</span> <span m='953000'>group
  in its side chain and, therefore, it will phosphorilate</span> <span m='957000'>this
  tyrosine. That is to say will tetraphosphate</span> <span m='962000'>group do it?
  It will phosphorilate this tyrosine.</span> </p><p><span m='966000'>So, these two
  rectangles are, in fact, tyrosine kinases. And what</span> <span m='971000'>happens,
  after the two subunits of the receptor have been brought</span> <span m='976000'>together,
  is thereafter, what one finds is that each of these</span> <span m='980000'>receptor
  subunits becomes multiply phosphorilated.</span> </p><p><span m='985000'>And each
  of these lollipops that I'm indicating here are sites where</span> <span m='990000'>there,
  a tyrosine residue has become phosphorilated.</span> </p><p><span m='995000'>In
  fact, there's a tail of the PDGF receptor that extends even further</span> <span
  m='998000'>to the cytoplasm which also acquires a number of different phosphates
  on</span> <span m='1002000'>it. And, again, I'd remind us that this</span> <span
  m='1006000'>phosphorylation is really what's often called transphosphorylation</span>
  <span m='1010000'>because each receptor molecule phosphorilates the tyrosine residues</span>
  <span m='1013000'>on the other. Obviously, when these two receptor molecules</span>
  <span m='1017000'>are far apart in the plain of the plasma membrane,</span> <span
  m='1021000'>this transphosphorylation cannot occur.</span> </p><p><span m='1025000'>But
  once the two tyrosine kinase residues, once the two tyrosine</span> <span m='1029000'>kinases
  have been brought together, pulled together by the dimerization</span> <span m='1033000'>of
  the receptor, now this cross-phosphorylation,</span> <span m='1037000'>on each phosphorylating
  the other can occur, and soon the receptors</span> <span m='1042000'>are highly
  phosphorilated. All of these phosphate groups,</span> <span m='1046000'>to repeat
  myself, being attached to tyrosine residues in their</span> <span m='1050000'>cytoplasmic
  domains. And this, in turn,</span> <span m='1055000'>creates interesting docking
  sites for a variety of other cytoplasmic</span> <span m='1059000'>signaling proteins.
  And we'll talk about some today and</span> <span m='1064000'>next time, but what
  I want to leave you with is the following impression.</span> </p><p><span m='1069000'>That
  after this phosphorylation actually occurs there are a number</span> <span m='1073000'>of
  molecules in the cytoplasm, signaling molecules that have</span> <span m='1078000'>affinity
  for binding these phosphotyrosines.</span> </p><p><span m='1083000'>When I say phosphotyrosine,
  obviously, I'm referring to the</span> <span m='1087000'>phosphorilated form of
  tyrosine that's been created by a tyrosine</span> <span m='1091000'>kinase enzyme.
  So, here's one molecule that can</span> <span m='1095000'>bind. Here's molecule
  A combined to one of these phosphates,</span> <span m='1099000'>another one combined
  to this phosphate specifically,</span> <span m='1103000'>and each of these molecules,
  once they're attracted to this</span> <span m='1107000'>phosphorilated receptor,
  can then emit downstream signals,</span> <span m='1111000'>send a variety of signals
  into the cell that ultimately end up in</span> <span m='1115000'>persuading the
  cell to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='1120000'>And so these effects here of
  growth factors in the G1 phase of the cell</span> <span m='1125000'>cycle are mediated
  by this transmembrane signaling,</span> <span m='1130000'>by the activation of these,
  of this PDGF receptor, for example,</span> <span m='1135000'>and by the resulting
  a release of downstream signals into the cell</span> <span m='1140000'>which pursued
  the cell to proliferate or not to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='1145000'>To
  be sure the, when platelets clot,</span> <span m='1148000'>when platelets aggregate
  and they release PDGF, they also release</span> <span m='1152000'>other kinds of
  growth factors. For instance, there's another</span> <span m='1155000'>growth factor
  that's called IGF1, insulin-like growth factor, and that</span> <span m='1159000'>has
  its own receptor on the surface of cells. And there are,</span> <span m='1162000'>on
  a cell, hundreds to thousands of these PDGF receptors,</span> <span m='1166000'>there
  are IGF receptors, there are EGF receptors.</span> </p><p><span m='1170000'>And
  a cell often will require several distinct kinds of growth</span> <span m='1174000'>factor
  activations in order to proliferate. So,</span> <span m='1178000'>this is only a
  minor part of the entire exposure that a cell</span> <span m='1182000'>experiences
  in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To elaborate on a point</span> <span m='1187000'>that
  I made last time, an important biological distinction</span> <span m='1191000'>between
  normal cells and cancer cells is the fact that cancer cells</span> <span m='1195000'>require
  relatively little growth factors or in the medium in order to</span> <span m='1199000'>proliferate.
  Normal cells have a very strong</span> <span m='1204000'>requirement for growth
  factors in their medium. And,</span> <span m='1208000'>therefore, what we can already
  imagine is the following kind of</span> <span m='1213000'>scenario. That cancer
  cells have someone deregulated this signaling</span> <span m='1217000'>pathway.
  Somehow they have become independent of the stimulation that</span> <span m='1221000'>is
  normally required, usually required for cells to</span> <span m='1226000'>proliferate.
  And, in fact, we know of several</span> <span m='1230000'>different ways by which
  cancer cells can acquire this independence.</span> </p><p><span m='1235000'>One
  of the most important ways, it's, it a really interesting one,</span> <span m='1239000'>is
  here's a cancer cell, which we'll talk about very shortly.</span> </p><p><span m='1243000'>And
  what you find in certain kinds of cancer cells is that the cancer</span> <span m='1247000'>cells
  themselves release growth factors into the medium.</span> </p><p><span m='1252000'>So,
  there are certain kinds of cancer cells that will release,</span> <span m='1256000'>let's
  say, a growth factor that's like EGF into the medium around it,</span> <span m='1260000'>around
  themselves. Well, you'll say that's kind of</span> <span m='1265000'>amusing. But
  so what. The important part here is that</span> <span m='1269000'>these same cancer
  cells have receptors for TG,</span> <span m='1273000'>for EGF on their surface.
  So, they're producing a growth</span> <span m='1277000'>factor and they can also
  respond to the same growth factor.</span> </p><p><span m='1281000'>And, therefore,
  this EGF, once it's released, can swim over</span> <span m='1285000'>here, activate
  the receptor and pursued the cell to start</span> <span m='1289000'>proliferating.
  This is, if you will,</span> <span m='1293000'>a positive feedback loop. But note
  here importantly that this,</span> <span m='1297000'>the growth of this cell is
  not being controlled by growth factors coming</span> <span m='1301000'>from cells
  elsewhere in the tissue or the body. Here we're not talking</span> <span m='1305000'>about
  different cells talking to one another. Here we're talking about a</span> <span
  m='1309000'>monologue where this cell is talking to itself. This is sometimes called</span>
  <span m='1313000'>autocrine signaling and refers to the fact that certain kinds
  of</span> <span m='1317000'>cancer cells are able to make growth factors to which
  they can respond.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>In fact, in normal tissues it's
  rare for a single cell type in a normal</span> <span m='1325000'>tissue to be able
  to make a growth factor and to be able to respond to</span> <span m='1329000'>the
  same growth factor. Why can it normally not respond to</span> <span m='1333000'>that
  growth factor? Because it won't make the receptor</span> <span m='1337000'>for the
  growth factor. For example, epithelial cells like</span> <span m='1341000'>the cells
  in your skin or the cells lining the gut,</span> <span m='1345000'>they can release
  PDGF, but they don't have a PDGF receptor</span> <span m='1349000'>on their surface.
  And, therefore,</span> <span m='1352000'>even though they release copious amounts
  of PDGF,</span> <span m='1356000'>that will not result in this auto stimulatory
  proliferation and,</span> <span m='1360000'>therefore, you don't have this decontrolled
  self-proliferation that</span> <span m='1364000'>you see often in cancer cells,
  this autocrine loop. In many kinds</span> <span m='1368000'>of cancer cells you
  have another alteration of this growth factor</span> <span m='1372000'>signaling
  pathway. And here what we see is the</span> <span m='1376000'>following. Instead
  of there being a small number of growth factor</span> <span m='1380000'>receptors
  on the cell surface, now there are ten or twenty or fifty</span> <span m='1384000'>times
  more than are normally present on the cell surface.</span> </p><p><span m='1388000'>In
  other words, this growth, the growth factor</span> <span m='1391000'>receptors are
  what is called overexpressed.</span> </p><p><span m='1394000'>And, therefore,</span>
  <span m='1403000'>a delicate balance is disrupted because normally,</span> <span
  m='1407000'>let's say, a cell with have on its surface 500 EGF receptors,</span>
  <span m='1411000'>but in many kinds of cancers probably 30% or 40% of all</span>
  <span m='1415000'>carcinomas, carcinomas are the tumors from epithelial tissues,</span>
  <span m='1419000'>you'll find overexpressed EGF receptor. Well,</span> <span m='1422000'>why
  is that interesting? It's interesting for the following</span> <span m='1426000'>reason.
  I told you before that the activation of a receptor depends on</span> <span m='1430000'>its
  ligand to persuading two receptor subunits to come together</span> <span m='1434000'>and
  start firing, as we just discussed.</span> </p><p><span m='1438000'>But if now all
  of a sudden the cell contains large amounts of this</span> <span m='1441000'>growth
  being expressed, of the growth factor receptor being</span> <span m='1444000'>expressed
  on the surface, ten or a hundred times more than</span> <span m='1447000'>normal,
  then these growth factor receptors are going to be rather</span> <span m='1451000'>densely
  packed on the cell surface. And now they may just come together</span> <span m='1454000'>because
  they happen to bump into each other very frequently.</span> </p><p><span m='1457000'>They
  don't need the growth factor to pull them together just because</span> <span m='1461000'>there
  are so many of them. So, there's random interactions,</span> <span m='1464000'>random
  bumping together And these two growth factor</span> <span m='1467000'>receptors
  may just bump together and thereby send signals into the cell</span> <span m='1471000'>persuading
  the cell that there's been some kind of growth factor in</span> <span m='1475000'>the
  extracellular domain that's been encountered when,</span> <span m='1479000'>in fact,
  all that's happened is that there are so many of these growth</span> <span m='1482000'>factor
  receptors around that they're constantly bumping into each other,</span> <span m='1486000'>and
  while they've collided with one another they can activate signaling</span> <span
  m='1490000'>and release growth stimulatory signals into the cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1494000'>There's another kind of, of alteration of growth factor</span> <span
  m='1498000'>receptors that's also seen in many kinds of human tumors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1503000'>For example, in, in glioblastomas, which is a brain tumor. And a</span>
  <span m='1508000'>glioblastoma has the following kind of, of receptor on the surface.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1513000'>It has truncated forms of the EGF receptor on the surface
  where a lot</span> <span m='1518000'>of the ectodomain is simply not present. So,
  here's the normal EGF</span> <span m='1522000'>receptor, here is a truncated EGF
  receptor where a lot of the</span> <span m='1527000'>extracellular domain, which
  I'm calling the ectodomain,</span> <span m='1532000'>has simply been lopped off.
  How has it be lopped off?</span> </p><p><span m='1537000'>Well, there's been a mutation
  it the gene which has,</span> <span m='1541000'>in effect, deleted segments in coding
  the N-terminus of the</span> <span m='1545000'>receptor protein, which normally
  sticks its head out</span> <span m='1549000'>of the cell. And now you have these
  truncated receptors.</span> </p><p><span m='1554000'>And such truncated EGF receptors
  are able to fire constitutively.</span> </p><p><span m='1558000'>Constitutively
  implies that these receptors are able to fire in a</span> <span m='1562000'>fashion
  that is no longer regulated by physiologic signals.</span> </p><p><span m='1567000'>It's
  a high steady rate. So now these receptor molecules,</span> <span m='1570000'>these
  truncated receptor molecules flood the cell with growth</span> <span m='1574000'>stimulatory
  signal and, for reasons that aren't really clear</span> <span m='1578000'>to this
  day, these two, these receptor, truncated receptor</span> <span m='1582000'>molecules
  can dimerize, they can come together even if</span> <span m='1586000'>there's no
  extracellular ligand present, even if there's no growth</span> <span m='1590000'>factor
  in the extracellular space. And we now realize,</span> <span m='1594000'>for example,
  that there are a variety of structurally altered</span> <span m='1598000'>receptors
  that fire constitutively into a cell in many kinds of human</span> <span m='1602000'>tumors.
  And in each case the cancer cell is deluded into thinking that</span> <span m='1606000'>some
  growth factor has been encountered out here when,</span> <span m='1610000'>in fact,
  there's not at all. Once again, what we see is a</span> <span m='1614000'>situation
  in which the cell, the cancer cell is being deluded</span> <span m='1618000'>into
  thinking there's growth factors present, extracellular space.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1623000'>None has been present at all. There have been a variety of drugs</span>
  <span m='1627000'>developed against, for example, lung cancer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1632000'>And there are a variety of different kinds of lung cancers.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1637000'>One is called non-small cell lung carcinoma. We don't have to deal</span>
  <span m='1642000'>with the subsets of lung cancers. And it turned out, it turned
  out</span> <span m='1646000'>that one of these drugs, it's called Iressa, had very
  mixed</span> <span m='1651000'>effects on patients.</span> </p><p><span m='1658000'>In
  about 90% of these, of the class of lung cancers,</span> <span m='1662000'>patients
  that were treated, the drug Iressa, used over the last several</span> <span m='1667000'>years,
  had almost no effect on the tumor treatment and the patients</span> <span m='1671000'>continued
  to, to proceed to their death. It had,</span> <span m='1676000'>it really had no
  effect. But in 10%, in fact, there was some</span> <span m='1680000'>dramatic responses
  and tumors shrunk down.</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>Now, normally a 10% response
  rate would be enough to cause a drug</span> <span m='1689000'>company to abandon
  all further development of the drug because it's</span> <span m='1693000'>just too
  low a response and who wants to take a drug where the</span> <span m='1697000'>chances
  of having a good response are as low as 10%?</span> </p><p><span m='1701000'>It's
  just not a good situation. But then some geneticists here in</span> <span m='1705000'>Boston,
  one group at the MGH and another over at the Dana Farber,</span> <span m='1709000'>began
  to look at the lung cancer cells that responded,</span> <span m='1713000'>i.e.,
  from tumors of patients that responded and shrank in response to</span> <span m='1717000'>the
  drug and the lung, and the lung cancer cells of</span> <span m='1721000'>patients
  who didn't. It turns out that Iressa is an</span> <span m='1724000'>inhibitor of
  the tyrosine kinase of the EGF receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='1728000'>That's
  how it was designed. In other words, this drug, it's a</span> <span m='1732000'>low
  molecular weight drug and it goes into the tyrosine kinase domain,</span> <span
  m='1736000'>that rectangular thing I showed you before very schematically,</span>
  <span m='1740000'>and it shuts down the firing of the receptor.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1744000'>That was the motivation behind creating this drug.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1748000'>So, Iressa shuts down the EGF receptor and 10% of lung cancer</span>
  <span m='1753000'>patients, their tumor shrank, the other 90% didn't, weren't</span>
  <span m='1758000'>effected at all. And what these two groups of</span> <span m='1762000'>geneticists
  found over the last three or four months is that the</span> <span m='1767000'>patients
  whose tumors responded had tumor cells where the EGF receptor</span> <span m='1772000'>was
  mutated and therefore firing in a constitutively active fashion.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1777000'>That is to say there were actually structural alterations in the</span>
  <span m='1780000'>receptor. This is a massive structural alteration of the</span>
  <span m='1784000'>receptor here, this truncation.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>But,
  in fact, in certain patients the 10% of patients that responded,</span> <span m='1792000'>there
  were much more subtle changes in the cytoplasmic domain of the</span> <span m='1796000'>protein
  which allowed these receptors to constitutively dimerize,</span> <span m='1800000'>once
  again, in a ligand independent fashion.</span> </p><p><span m='1804000'>So, these
  subtle mutations mimic, in effect, the consequences of</span> <span m='1808000'>deleting
  or truncating the extracellular domain in that in both</span> <span m='1812000'>cases
  one gets a ligand independent receptor. In those cases where</span> <span m='1816000'>these,
  where the patients had a mutant EGF receptor,</span> <span m='1820000'>structurally
  altered EGF receptor that was firing constitutively,</span> <span m='1824000'>there
  were dramatic responses to the Iressa drug.</span> </p><p><span m='1828000'>In the
  90% of patients where there was no effective response to the</span> <span m='1831000'>drug,
  the EGF receptor was wild-type, it was present in a wild-type</span> <span m='1835000'>configuration.
  It might have been slightly</span> <span m='1839000'>overexpressed but it wasn't,
  but it continued to, to function</span> <span m='1843000'>essentially as a normal
  EGF receptor. And this represents a major advance</span> <span m='1846000'>in cancer
  therapy because it suggests that one has to begin to</span> <span m='1850000'>understand
  what subsets of patients one should treat with a drug which</span> <span m='1854000'>can,
  on its own, have quite toxic effects on the</span> <span m='1858000'>patient. And,
  from now on,</span> <span m='1861000'>to state the obvious, when one gets lung cancer
  patients</span> <span m='1865000'>one will check quickly using various reactions,
  like the PCR reaction,</span> <span m='1869000'>to see whether or not their cancer
  cells have a mutated EGF receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='1873000'>And, if they
  do, they will be candidates for Iressa treatment with</span> <span m='1876000'>the
  expectation that 60%, 80% or even 100% of them will have</span> <span m='1880000'>tumors
  that respond. And if they don't have a mutated</span> <span m='1884000'>EGF receptor
  then they will not be subjected to a treatment</span> <span m='1888000'>by this
  drug. This is the beginning of a new era</span> <span m='1891000'>of cancer drug
  treatment. It's called rational drug design,</span> <span m='1895000'>or rational
  treatment, where you don't just lump all the patients</span> <span m='1899000'>with
  a certain disease together and say let's give them all this drug</span> <span m='1903000'>and
  throw things up in the air and see what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='1906000'>Here
  one begins to do a genetic diagnosis of the genomes of the</span> <span m='1910000'>patient's
  cancer cells in order to determine whether or not they have</span> <span m='1914000'>certain
  mutated genes. In this case we're referring to one</span> <span m='1918000'>of these
  growth factor receptors. By the way, we're talking about lung</span> <span m='1922000'>cancer
  today, right? If you are smoking now,</span> <span m='1926000'>I always ask the
  class how many people are smoking,</span> <span m='1930000'>and nobody has the,
  has the moral fortitude to raise their hands.</span> </p><p><span m='1934000'>But
  if you are smoking now and you started at this age and you continue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1938000'>And, by the way, if you start at your age and you</span> <span m='1942000'>continue
  smoke, stopping smoking is actually a bit</span> <span m='1946000'>more difficult,
  quite a bit more difficult than</span> <span m='1950000'>stopping heroine. That's
  pretty interesting,</span> <span m='1954000'>right? So, if you continue to smoke
  now you will be healthy for a pretty</span> <span m='1958000'>long period of time,
  probably another 20 or 30 years.</span> </p><p><span m='1962000'>And for you that
  sounds like forever, but when you get to be</span> <span m='1966000'>about 40 or
  50 things are going to start falling apart.</span> </p><p><span m='1970000'>Soon
  you won't be able to be very athletic, soon your lungs are going</span> <span m='1974000'>to
  be able, are going to degrade, and by the time you reach your</span> <span m='1978000'>fifties,
  sixties or seventies what's going to happen is you will,</span> <span m='1982000'>on
  average, have a six to eight year shortened life expectancy.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1986000'>Now you say six to eight years is not that much,</span> <span m='1989000'>but
  it really is. You know, when you get to be 70 and</span> <span m='1993000'>you think
  you're going to die next year or you're going to die in six</span> <span m='1997000'>or
  eight years it makes a big difference. Six to eight years is</span> <span m='2000000'>an
  enormous difference in life expectancy. 20% of all people who</span> <span m='2004000'>died
  last year in this country, 20% of all deaths came from</span> <span m='2008000'>cigarette
  smoking. Imagine that. And when you die from cigarette</span> <span m='2012000'>smokes,
  smoking sometimes you get lung cancer. There probably were,</span> <span m='2016000'>I
  think, 600,000 people who died from smoking last year.</span> </p><p><span m='2020000'>Six
  hundred thousand. There were 55,000 American soldiers who died in</span> <span m='2024000'>Vietnam
  in the whole war, there were 220,000 American soldiers</span> <span m='2028000'>who
  died in all of World War II, and last year in this, and there</span> <span m='2032000'>were
  3,000, or 2, 00 people who died in the World</span> <span m='2036000'>Trade Center.
  All right? Got all those numbers?</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>So, last year
  600, 00 people died premature deaths</span> <span m='2045000'>because they were
  smoking. How many people died last year from</span> <span m='2050000'>smoking marijuana?
  Maybe two or three,</span> <span m='2055000'>I don't know. [APPLAUSE] Am I urging
  you to do any kind of smoking?</span> </p><p><span m='2060000'>I'm not saying marijuana
  smoking is good for you, but I just want you to</span> <span m='2065000'>get these
  things in mind, the perspective.</span> </p><p><span m='2070000'>If you smoke, you
  know, in many countries, including this</span> <span m='2073000'>one, there isn't
  much tension by, given by the government to,</span> <span m='2077000'>dissuading
  people from smoking, and here's the reason why. If you</span> <span m='2080000'>smoke,
  and you going to get, get sick eventually, eventually the</span> <span m='2084000'>country
  is always going to have to pay for your medical costs,</span> <span m='2087000'>right?
  Sooner or later we all have to pay for the costs of people who</span> <span m='2091000'>get
  sick. It's all shared in one way or another.</span> </p><p><span m='2094000'>But
  it's not such a big problem for a government like the</span> <span m='2098000'>American
  government. Because if you smoke you're going to</span> <span m='2102000'>die early
  enough that you won't draw on social security.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>And,
  therefore, the government actually saves money by your smoking,</span> <span m='2110000'>because
  by the time they add up how much they get on the tobacco tax and</span> <span m='2114000'>how
  much they earn by your not living long enough to draw a pension,</span> <span m='2118000'>it's
  much better, it's much more money than how much</span> <span m='2122000'>it's going
  to cost to take care of you while you're dying from</span> <span m='2126000'>emphysema
  or bladder cancer or lung cancer or heart disease.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>Many
  more people die from heart attacks due to smoking than die from</span> <span m='2133000'>lung
  cancer, in fact. So, think about this.</span> </p><p><span m='2137000'>Think about
  this. If you smoke it's probably a good time to stop</span> <span m='2141000'>because
  if you continue at your age, especially if you're women, which is</span> <span m='2145000'>women,
  for some reason women have a harder time stopping than men,</span> <span m='2148000'>they
  can't say why. It's probably some physiological thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2152000'>If
  you, if you continue now at your age, it will be almost impossible to</span> <span
  m='2156000'>stop. If you live with smokers ask them to leave. [LAUGHTER]</span>
  <span m='2160000'>If you live at home with your parents and they smoke tell them</span>
  <span m='2164000'>it's time for them to leave. Throw them out of the house.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2168000'>Smoke, second-hand smoking killed probably between 60,</span>
  <span m='2172000'>00 and 80,000 people last year in this country. Second-hand smoke.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2176000'>And, by the way, if you want to see an interesting phenomenon,</span>
  <span m='2180000'>go to a veterinary hospital because there they with great frequently,</span>
  <span m='2184000'>frequency treat dogs who have lung cancer. And why do they</span>
  <span m='2188000'>have lung cancer? Not in 99% of the cases,</span> <span m='2192000'>in
  100% of the cases these dogs live with owners who smoke.</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>An
  average tobacco smoker goes through six or eight dogs in his or</span> <span m='2200000'>her
  lifetime. [LAUGHTER] It's true. It's absolutely true.</span> </p><p><span m='2204000'>So
  if you, if you think the dogs, if that's a fact for the, for the,</span> <span m='2209000'>for
  the dog owners, think about what's happening to the</span> <span m='2213000'>inside
  of your lungs. And so I'm going to take back what</span> <span m='2217000'>I said
  before. Before I told you that the most</span> <span m='2222000'>important thing
  for you to do in this course is to learn how to think</span> <span m='2226000'>clearly
  and to assess and to distil conceptually complex material,</span> <span m='2230000'>there's
  actually one more thing that's even more important to get</span> <span m='2234000'>out
  of this course, if you do, and that is to stop</span> <span m='2238000'>smoking.
  If you do that, if you do that it'll be vastly more</span> <span m='2242000'>important
  for the rest of your life than anything you learn here.</span> </p><p><span m='2246000'>So,
  write that down, vastly more important. You may think it's</span> <span m='2250000'>glamorous,
  you may think it's exciting, but keep in mind,</span> <span m='2254000'>people who
  stop smoking have vastly greater effects on reducing the</span> <span m='2258000'>morbidity
  and the mortality in this country than anything that cancer</span> <span m='2262000'>researchers
  can do. Keep that in mind.</span> </p><p><span m='2266000'>And if you start smoking
  now and you think that somehow the cancer</span> <span m='2270000'>researchers are
  going to be able to come up with some miracle cure by</span> <span m='2273000'>this
  time you start coughing and start spitting up blood,</span> <span m='2276000'>don't
  be so certain. They may not be able to save you,</span> <span m='2280000'>to pull
  your fat out of the fire. So, I don't know whether I,</span> <span m='2284000'>I
  gave this message in a very subtle way or I hit you over the head with</span> <span
  m='2288000'>it. [LAUGHTER] But think, think about that. Now, now we're</span> <span
  m='2292000'>going to focus on lung cancer, we're going to focus on cancer</span>
  <span m='2296000'>because it's one of the consequences of cigarette smoking,</span>
  <span m='2300000'>but it's a disease we want to talk about both this time and next
  time,</span> <span m='2304000'>and we want to relate it here to the cell cycle and,</span>
  <span m='2308000'>and how the growth of cell proliferation occurs.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2312000'>I told you last time that a human tumor is roughly-speaking about,</span>
  <span m='2316000'>a human body roughly carries three times ten to the thirteenth
  cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2320000'>So, that's quite a few cells. That's how
  many cells there are in</span> <span m='2324000'>the human body, plus or minus.
  A human tumor of one,</span> <span m='2328000'>let's say one cubic centimeter is
  roughly ten to the ninth cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2332000'>So, a tiny tumor
  this way already has a billion cells in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2336000'>And
  what I want to say is that those billion cells,</span> <span m='2340000'>or if the
  tumor grows larger to ten to a hundred billion cells,</span> <span m='2344000'>it's
  still not that much compared with the overall size of the body.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2349000'>But tumors of that size can kill you. And one, an interesting and</span>
  <span m='2354000'>important thing to realize about all the cancer cells in that
  tumor mass</span> <span m='2359000'>is that they all descend from a single progenitor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2364000'>In other words, if we imagine a situation where here are
  a whole</span> <span m='2369000'>bunch of normal cells and here's the boundary between
  normalcy up here</span> <span m='2374000'>and malignancy, malignancy obviously refers
  to</span> <span m='2380000'>cancer, we could imagine where there are many cells
  which independently</span> <span m='2385000'>cross the boundary from one to the
  other and become the progenitors of</span> <span m='2390000'>a vast tumor mass.
  But that's not what happens.</span> </p><p><span m='2395000'>What happens, in fact,
  is that only one cell gets converted or becomes,</span> <span m='2400000'>as one
  says here, it becomes transformed from a normal cell into</span> <span m='2405000'>a
  cancer cell. And this transformation causes this</span> <span m='2410000'>one cell
  to become the progenitor, the ancestor of all the cells in the</span> <span m='2415000'>tumor
  mass. So, one important realization we have</span> <span m='2420000'>about looking
  at different tumors is that cancers are monoclonal growths,</span> <span m='2425000'>i.e.,
  they form clonal populations. They're monoclonal in the sense that</span> <span
  m='2430000'>they all are genetically derived from a single common ancestor rather</span>
  <span m='2435000'>than being polyclonal. What else can we say about cancer</span>
  <span m='2440000'>cells or the cells in a tumor? If you take cells out of Petri
  dish,</span> <span m='2444000'>out of an animal or a human and put them on a Petri
  dish,</span> <span m='2448000'>excuse me, and you put them there, then what you'll
  see is following</span> <span m='2452000'>interesting behavior. If you put normal
  cells in a Petri</span> <span m='2456000'>dish they'll grow across the bottom of
  the Petri dish until they cover</span> <span m='2460000'>the entire bottom of the
  Petri dish.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>So, you can put a hundred cells in and
  they'll continue to proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='2468000'>Let's look at the
  Petri dish from top down, so you might have a small</span> <span m='2472000'>number
  of cells here and here, and normal cells will continue to</span> <span m='2476000'>proliferate
  until they begin to touch one another,</span> <span m='2481000'>and then they'll
  stop growing. And this stopping of growing is,</span> <span m='2485000'>is the phenomenon
  that's called contact inhibition.</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>So, a normal cell
  will indicate contact inhibition.</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>And to state,
  to state the obvious, this phenomenon or this behavior of</span> <span m='2497000'>contact
  inhibition creates what's called a cell monolayer because if</span> <span m='2500000'>the
  cell stopped growing once they touch each other they're not going</span> <span m='2504000'>to
  be two or three or four layers of cells in the Petri dish.</span> </p><p><span m='2507000'>So,
  here we're looking at this Petri dish in cross-section and</span> <span m='2511000'>there's
  a monolayer of normal cells here.</span> </p><p><span m='2515000'>If you put a cancer
  cell in the Petri dish, or let's put here a</span> <span m='2518000'>cancer cell,
  we'll seed it amidst normal cells, what will happen is</span> <span m='2522000'>that
  the cancer cell lacks, has lost contact inhibition,</span> <span m='2526000'>and
  the cancer cell will continue to proliferate even after it's touched</span> <span
  m='2529000'>its neighbors. So, it has lost cancer,</span> <span m='2533000'>it has
  lost contact inhibition and will start growing on top of,</span> <span m='2537000'>the
  cancer cells will start growing on top of each other because they</span> <span m='2540000'>don't
  mind growing in spite of their having intimate contact with</span> <span m='2544000'>neighboring
  cells. And, in fact, what you can do is</span> <span m='2548000'>the following experiment.
  You can put cells in a Petri dish</span> <span m='2552000'>like this, a whole bunch
  of normal cells in a Petri dish,</span> <span m='2557000'>and then you can put into
  them some kind of transforming influence,</span> <span m='2562000'>which we'll talk
  about very shortly, i.e., you can influence some of</span> <span m='2567000'>these
  cells to become transformed. And how we do so we'll tell, we'll</span> <span m='2572000'>hold
  in abeyance just for a moment. So, we'll have this cell. We'll do</span> <span m='2577000'>this
  cell to become transformed and this cell to become transformed.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2582000'>And what will happen is that those cells will begin to form a very</span>
  <span m='2585000'>thick clump of cells, these blue ones, the ones that are</span>
  <span m='2589000'>transformed. Whereas, all the other cells will grow until</span>
  <span m='2593000'>they form a monolayer at which point they'll stop proliferating.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2596000'>So, the cancer cells keep piling up and the transformed
  cells,</span> <span m='2600000'>transformed by one or another agent, we won't talk
  about that yet,</span> <span m='2604000'>continue to proliferate long after the
  normal cells have stopped</span> <span m='2608000'>proliferating. The normal cells
  having stopped</span> <span m='2611000'>proliferating because they're contact inhibited.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2615000'>And, therefore, they'll form this clump of cells which
  we'll call a</span> <span m='2618000'>focus. And if you hold the Petri dish up to
  the light and you look at</span> <span m='2622000'>it and there are some transformed
  cells present,</span> <span m='2625000'>you can see the foci, they're very thick.
  Whereas,</span> <span m='2629000'>the thin monolayer of cells will just look pretty
  transparent.</span> </p><p><span m='2632000'>But this focus will look highly opaque
  by virtue of the multiple</span> <span m='2636000'>layers of cells that are involved
  in it.</span> </p><p><span m='2640000'>Now, in fact, we can begin to ask the question
  of how and why cells</span> <span m='2645000'>like this become transformed and exhibit
  this behavior.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>In fact, until the 1980s there wasn't
  really a clear understanding</span> <span m='2656000'>about how that happened. I've
  already given you some clues</span> <span m='2661000'>because I've already told
  you the fact that certain cancer cells carry</span> <span m='2667000'>mutant genes.
  What kind of mutant genes?</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>Well, I gave you, in
  anticipation of discussion,</span> <span m='2676000'>the fact that certain cancer
  cells carry mutant genes that specify</span> <span m='2680000'>mutant growth factor
  receptors. And these mutant growth factor</span> <span m='2684000'>receptors, as
  I indicated, begin to push the cell the</span> <span m='2689000'>proliferate. And
  so that already anticipates a conclusion we're about</span> <span m='2693000'>to
  make, which is that the reason why cancer cells behave abnormally</span> <span m='2697000'>is
  that they carry mutant genes. Now, let's talk about the nature of</span> <span m='2702000'>these
  mutant genes because, if you look at these mutant genes,</span> <span m='2707000'>invariably
  they are the consequences of what we call somatic mutations.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2712000'>By that I mean, I mean the following. Let's say we all start</span>
  <span m='2717000'>out with a really good set of genes. And, thank the good Lord,
  we all do.</span> </p><p><span m='2722000'>But as we go through life through accidents
  or through intent we can</span> <span m='2727000'>damage these genes. We can muck
  them up in different</span> <span m='2732000'>ways. And these genes, this damage
  may occur to cells in</span> <span m='2736000'>the skin, they may occur to cells
  in your belly, they may occur to cells</span> <span m='2741000'>in the brain, and
  these are called somatic mutations in contrast to the</span> <span m='2745000'>germline
  mutations that affect one's offspring. Because,</span> <span m='2750000'>as you
  must realize by now, the only way you can have mutations</span> <span m='2754000'>that
  affect your descendents is if those mutations strike in the gonads</span> <span
  m='2759000'>and affect the genomes of either sperm or egg.</span> </p><p><span m='2764000'>But
  the mutations occurring everywhere else in the body outside</span> <span m='2768000'>of
  the gonads, because they occur in,</span> <span m='2772000'>I think I, this is somatic,
  excuse me, because they occur in the</span> <span m='2776000'>soma, the soma is
  defined as the entirety of the body outside of the</span> <span m='2781000'>gonads,
  outside of the germi, these somatic mutations might affect</span> <span m='2785000'>the
  tissues around them but they will not be transmitted from one</span> <span m='2789000'>organismic
  generation to the next. And, accordingly,</span> <span m='2794000'>we begin to imagine,
  in fact, correctly we begin to</span> <span m='2798000'>construct this model that
  one of the most important mechanisms of</span> <span m='2802000'>creating a cancer
  cell is to damage its genome. So,</span> <span m='2806000'>I'll tell you a story
  now, which I'm only going to finish on</span> <span m='2810000'>Monday. We have,
  let's imagine, a 55-year-old,</span> <span m='2814000'>this is a true story, 55-year-old
  man who's been smoking since he or</span> <span m='2818000'>she, he was 15 years
  old. So, he's been smoking for 40 years.</span> </p><p><span m='2822000'>And during
  those periods of 40 years, by the way, I'm not saying whether</span> <span m='2826000'>I'm
  for or against smoking, you understand that. During that</span> <span m='2830000'>period
  of 40 years this person has been introducing large amounts of</span> <span m='2835000'>tobacco
  smoke compounds into his lungs. Now, it turns out that these</span> <span m='2839000'>compounds,
  this tobacco smoke compounds are carcinogens.</span> </p><p><span m='2843000'>You
  know carcinogen means it causes cancer. But it happens also to be</span> <span m='2848000'>the
  case that a lot of carcinogens, cancer-causing compounds are also</span> <span m='2852000'>mutagens.
  That is to say they can mutate DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2857000'>So, here we
  have a scenario that we're going to set up for next time.</span> </p><p><span m='2861000'>55-year-old
  man. Smokes for 40 years. Dumps a lot of carcinogens</span> <span m='2866000'>into
  his lungs. The carcinogens which are highly,</span> <span m='2870000'>which induce
  mutations very potently are passed from his lungs into his</span> <span m='2875000'>blood
  and there go from the blood into the kidneys.</span> </p><p><span m='2880000'>And
  from the kidneys they are excreted into the urine and then</span> <span m='2884000'>they
  sit around in the bladder for a while. And let's imagine now that</span> <span m='2889000'>the
  urine of this man has all of these highly mutation-active</span> <span m='2893000'>carcinogens
  in his urine, which, in principle, can begin now</span> <span m='2898000'>to strike
  out and attack the genomes of the cells lining the urinary</span> <span m='2903000'>bladder.
  In other words, by, by smoking cigarettes you can</span> <span m='2907000'>actually
  mutate the genomes, somatic mutation, the genomes of</span> <span m='2912000'>cells
  lining the bladder of the, the urinary bladder, or, of course,</span> <span m='2917000'>to
  state the obvious, you can also mutate the genomes of the cells</span> <span m='2921000'>lining
  the alveoli in the lungs. That's why you get lung cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='2926000'>And
  a consequence of this can be, with serious probability, that now</span> <span m='2930000'>some
  of these cells become mutated and that, in turn,</span> <span m='2934000'>will lead
  to a life-threatening tumor. So, on this very cheerful</span> <span m='2938000'>note
  and your having heard two major take-home lessons, have</span> <span m='2942000'>a
  great weekend. See you on Monday. Enjoy</span> <span m='2947000'>the parade tomorrow.</span>
