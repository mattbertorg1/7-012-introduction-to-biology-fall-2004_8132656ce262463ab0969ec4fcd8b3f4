transcript: '<p><span m=''1000''>Good morning. Good morning, yes, thank you. Well,
  we were</span> <span m=''8000''>coming to the end of the term rather soon. That''s
  sad.</span> </p><p><span m=''16000''>And, what I''d like to do today is, picking
  up on some of the stuff that</span> <span m=''24000''>Bob has been doing, begin
  to show how the things we''ve</span> <span m=''31000''>learned about understanding
  molecular biology,</span> <span m=''35000''>biochemistry, genetics, all come together
  to help us treat</span> <span m=''40000''>disease. That is after all the point of
  all this.</span> </p><p><span m=''44000''>Bob spoke about this with respect to cancer.
  Today my goal is to talk</span> <span m=''48000''>about this with respect to heart
  disease. We''ve got about 50 minutes</span> <span m=''53000''>or so, and I''d like
  to see if we could solve heart disease by the end</span> <span m=''57000''>of the
  period. That seems like a reasonable goal.</span> </p><p><span m=''62000''>And so,
  I would like you, by the end of today''s class,</span> <span m=''67000''>to design
  a therapy to cure most people or at least to prevent a</span> <span m=''72000''>couple
  million heart attacks, all right? So, that''s our goal.</span> </p><p><span m=''77000''>So,
  we''d better get to work if we''re going to accomplish that in</span> <span m=''82000''>the
  allotted time. So, first off, you need to know a</span> <span m=''87000''>little
  something about heart disease.</span> </p><p><span m=''92000''>The heart: that''s
  obviously an important component of understanding</span> <span m=''99000''>heart
  disease. What''s the heart do?</span> </p><p><span m=''106000''>The heart pumps
  blood, and to and from tissues providing</span> <span m=''113000''>nutrients, hormones,
  removing waste products,</span> <span m=''120000''>cells, for example, it pumps
  around red blood cells and</span> <span m=''124000''>white blood cells and things
  like that, and of course oxygen in the</span> <span m=''129000''>blood. These are
  incredibly important things that your heart</span> <span m=''134000''>does. If your
  heart should stop doing it for even relatively brief</span> <span m=''139000''>periods
  of time, it''s very bad news.</span> </p><p><span m=''143000''>This is extremely
  serious not to have your heart pumping,</span> <span m=''148000''>as you all know.
  One of the ways in which you run</span> <span m=''154000''>into trouble with your
  heart pumping is if the vessels that carry blood</span> <span m=''161000''>away
  from the heart to the periphery arteries become clogged.</span> </p><p><span m=''169000''>Just
  simple plumbing problem here: if they become clogged and the</span> <span m=''176000''>arterial
  wall gets build ups here, we have what is called</span> <span m=''182000''>arteriosclerosis.
  And, it can lead eventually to</span> <span m=''188000''>nearly complete blockade
  of a vessel. And if that vessel,</span> <span m=''193000''>for example, were to
  be supplying something important like,</span> <span m=''198000''>for example, the
  blood supply to the heart muscles itself,</span> <span m=''204000''>that would be
  extremely bad, all right, because then your heart</span> <span m=''209000''>muscles
  wouldn''t have oxygen, and they would quickly die.</span> </p><p><span m=''215000''>Other
  problems can happen here too, where you could have insufficient</span> <span m=''221000''>blood
  supply to the brain. What happens when your brain</span> <span m=''227000''>doesn''t
  get enough oxygen: stroke. So, we have many, many of these</span> <span m=''233000''>issues.
  So, if it''s the brain: stroke. If the tissue that doesn''t</span> <span m=''239000''>get
  enough oxygen is the heart, you''ve got enough heart attack.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''246000''>And so, we want to prevent this process of the buildup of plaques in</span>
  <span m=''252000''>the arteries. And these plaques are made up of complex mixtures
  of</span> <span m=''258000''>proteins, lipids, and cholesterol, and surely by now</span>
  <span m=''264000''>you all know that cholesterol was this evil molecule,</span>
  <span m=''270000''>and it will indeed be the villain of today''s story.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''276000''>So, that''s the basic plan there. I''ll draw your basic plumbing</span>
  <span m=''282000''>diagram here just so you have it. We''ve got a heart here. This
  is</span> <span m=''289000''>your heart, somewhat simplified picture here. The heart
  pumps blood</span> <span m=''296000''>that goes out to the body, to the heart itself,
  to the brain,</span> <span m=''302000''>and of course this before it''s doing it
  is receiving oxygenated</span> <span m=''309000''>blood from the lungs. So, it''s
  really all of these places</span> <span m=''316000''>that we''re trying to keep
  flowing. The number of heart attacks, deaths</span> <span m=''323000''>from heart
  attacks, and other cardiovascular disease is</span> <span m=''330000''>extraordinarily
  high. It''s on the order of 1.</span> </p><p><span m=''336000''>million deaths per
  year. By contrast, number of deaths from</span> <span m=''341000''>cancer is about
  600, 00 or so, something like that.</span> </p><p><span m=''345000''>And, this has
  been coming down a little bit for cardiovascular</span> <span m=''350000''>disease
  partly because of some of the things we''ll talk about today.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''355000''>But it still is a leading killer of adults in this country,</span>
  <span m=''360000''>and indeed the leading killer of adults in this country,</span>
  <span m=''365000''>although there are projections that cancer may take over in that
  role.</span> </p><p><span m=''369000''>Heart disease is incredibly important. So,</span>
  <span m=''373000''>if we''re going to try to understand how we''re going to prevent
  these</span> <span m=''377000''>plaques, and I''ve told you already, and you know
  from the media that</span> <span m=''381000''>these plaques have lots of cholesterol
  in them,</span> <span m=''385000''>and that you all know that high cholesterol is
  bad,</span> <span m=''389000''>how do we know that high cholesterol is bad?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''393000''>Correlation. Epidemiological correlation is one,</span>
  <span m=''396000''>and as we will see today, there are some other, more direct</span>
  <span m=''400000''>results coming out of genetics that point to this as well.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''403000''>What is cholesterol? Let''s talk about cholesterol.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''407000''>So, this is the structure</span> <span m=''417000''>of
  cholesterol.</span> </p><p><span m=''438000''>There we go. That''s cholesterol.
  It''s a very complex, interesting</span> <span m=''445000''>molecule here with lots
  of rings. It is a waxy substance. If you</span> <span m=''452000''>were to look
  at a test tube with a lot of cholesterol in it,</span> <span m=''459000''>it would
  look like wax. And, it is extremely hydrophobic. It</span> <span m=''466000''>will
  not dissolve in water. So, if cholesterol is such an evil</span> <span m=''474000''>molecule
  as you all know from the news media, why do we have</span> <span m=''481000''>this
  evil molecule? Sorry? Well, because it''s</span> <span m=''488000''>absolutely essential
  for life. I mean, despite it''s rep as an evil</span> <span m=''495000''>molecule,
  it''s extraordinarily important. The uses of cholesterol</span> <span m=''501000''>are
  many. One you''ve already said. It plays a structural role in cell</span> <span
  m=''508000''>membranes, the plasma membrane. This is not a big player role in the</span>
  <span m=''515000''>cell membrane. But about half of all the lipids in</span> <span
  m=''521000''>the cell membrane are cholesterol. It''s a huge component. Cholesterol</span>
  <span m=''527000''>molecules, because of their funny shape, helps stiffen membranes
  and</span> <span m=''533000''>strengthen membranes. So they strengthen and stiffen
  the</span> <span m=''539000''>membrane. Also, not only are half of the</span> <span
  m=''546000''>lipids in your cell membranes cholesterol, half of the cholesterol</span>
  <span m=''553000''>in your body is in the cell membranes. So,</span> <span m=''560000''>that''s
  the major location. They''re also used, these complex</span> <span m=''567000''>molecules,
  as precursors for the synthesis of steroid hormones.</span> </p><p><span m=''574000''>Steroid
  hormones, of course, also are evil these days.</span> </p><p><span m=''578000''>Those
  of you who checked the New York Times today saw that Jason</span> <span m=''582000''>Giambi
  admitted using steroids to a grand jury. But steroids are also,</span> <span m=''587000''>notwithstanding
  those kinds of things, good for you.</span> </p><p><span m=''591000''>What are some
  important steroids in your bodies: testosterone,</span> <span m=''596000''>estrogen,
  glucocorticoids, all of these things are made</span> <span m=''600000''>from cholesterol.
  It was a precursor.</span> </p><p><span m=''606000''>And if you look at the structure
  of steroid hormones,</span> <span m=''612000''>you recognize that this coupled ring
  structure here is very similar to</span> <span m=''618000''>what''s in them. And
  indeed, they''re derivatized</span> <span m=''625000''>from them. It''s also a precursor
  for the synthesis of vitamin D.</span> </p><p><span m=''631000''>And, it is a precursor
  for the synthesis of bile acids.</span> </p><p><span m=''638000''>When your body
  takes in triglycerides in your food supply</span> <span m=''644000''>and you need
  to transport fats like triglycerides across your intestine,</span> <span m=''651000''>they
  need to be emulsified. The way that triglycerides are emulsified</span> <span m=''658000''>are
  with bile acids. So, you secrete bile acids into your</span> <span m=''664000''>digestive
  tract. It helps emulsify fats and helps</span> <span m=''668000''>you take them
  up. So, cholesterol plays a crucial</span> <span m=''673000''>structural role, a
  biochemical role with regard to</span> <span m=''678000''>hormones, with regard
  to vitamin D synthesis, and with regard to bile</span> <span m=''682000''>acid synthesis.
  So, cholesterol was a good thing,</span> <span m=''687000''>all right. Now, if cholesterol
  is so</span> <span m=''692000''>extraordinarily hydrophobic, how is it that cholesterol
  gets</span> <span m=''697000''>around the body? It''s almost entirely non-polar.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''702000''>It doesn''t dissolve in water. It has one little hydroxyl
  there.</span> </p><p><span m=''706000''>It''s not going to help a lot. Yep? Well,
  the first thing actually is</span> <span m=''711000''>it''s chemically modified
  to make it a little hydrophilic and then it</span> <span m=''716000''>does bind
  to hydrophilic proteins and particles that help</span> <span m=''721000''>get it
  around. So, the first thing that happens,</span> <span m=''726000''>to be able to,
  even just to store cholesterol in any useful form,</span> <span m=''730000''>it''s
  not stored as cholesterol because it''s so waxy.</span> </p><p><span m=''735000''>It
  would just collapse as a waxy deposit. What happens is it is</span> <span m=''740000''>stored
  and transported as cholesterol ester.</span> </p><p><span m=''745000''>A cholesterol
  ester,</span> <span m=''763000''>or CE, and its esterified by adding to it, here''s
  my cholesterol again.</span> </p><p><span m=''773000''>I''ll be even less, there
  we go.</span> </p><p><span m=''792000''>This hydroxyl here is used now for a fatty
  acid linkage.</span> </p><p><span m=''799000''>And with this fatty acid attached
  to the cholesterol,</span> <span m=''806000''>you have a cholesterol ester. And
  this is somewhat more soluble.</span> </p><p><span m=''815000''>All right, where
  do you get your cholesterol from?</span> </p><p><span m=''825000''>Diet. Do we eat
  cholesterol? Butter''s got cholesterol. What</span> <span m=''835000''>else has
  got cholesterol? Eggs, a lot of cholesterol.</span> </p><p><span m=''846000''>So,
  we eat cholesterol. So, let''s get our sources of</span> <span m=''857000''>cholesterol:
  number one, diet. And, sources, eggs,</span> <span m=''868000''>butter, etc. What
  else beyond diet?</span> </p><p><span m=''876000''>Yeah? Your body actually makes
  it. Your own endogenous synthesis. And</span> <span m=''882000''>you would imagine
  that this is pretty important because cholesterol,</span> <span m=''888000''>being
  half of all plasma membranes, you can''t just count on cholesterol</span> <span
  m=''894000''>being sufficiently there in your diet.</span> </p><p><span m=''900000''>So,
  your body also synthesizes cholesterol. The synthesis of</span> <span m=''907000''>cholesterol
  is a thing of beauty. It starts with an incredibly simple</span> <span m=''914000''>molecule,
  acetic acid, right? And it goes through many</span> <span m=''921000''>steps and
  becomes cholesterol, which I will summarize here as many</span> <span m=''929000''>steps,
  OK? We''ll come back and talk a moment</span> <span m=''934000''>about a few of
  those steps. But it''s one of these real triumphs</span> <span m=''938000''>of biochemistry;
  the people have worked out the whole pathway for</span> <span m=''942000''>cholesterol
  biosynthesis. But it''s not, I think, necessary to</span> <span m=''946000''>remember
  all of the steps there. But it is quite remarkable to go</span> <span m=''950000''>from
  such an extremely simple molecule like acetic acid all the</span> <span m=''954000''>way
  to cholesterol. And the fact that people worked all</span> <span m=''958000''>this
  out was a great achievement. All right, so those are some of the</span> <span m=''962000''>things
  you need. Then, carrying on here,</span> <span m=''967000''>we''ve got cholesterol
  coming in by diet. We''re synthesizing</span> <span m=''971000''>cholesterol. We''re
  making cholesterol esters.</span> </p><p><span m=''976000''>We''ve got to get them
  around the body. So now,</span> <span m=''981000''>we''re going to take these cholesterol
  esters and we''re going</span> <span m=''985000''>to package them up and send them
  off. So, you were saying that proteins</span> <span m=''990000''>would be used.
  Hydrophilic proteins might be used.</span> </p><p><span m=''998000''>And indeed,
  that is the case. Lipoproteins and lipoprotein</span> <span m=''1008000''>particles,
  lipo being fat, of course, are used to transport</span> <span m=''1018000''>cholesterol
  and actually triglycerins too.</span> </p><p><span m=''1028000''>They are transported
  in particles that look roughly like this.</span> </p><p><span m=''1040000''>They
  have a monolayer of phospholipids with some protein</span> <span m=''1053000''>stuck
  in this monolayer of phospholipid.</span> </p><p><span m=''1066000''>And, inside
  is where these cholesterol esters go.</span> </p><p><span m=''1075000''>So, actually
  this is where cholesterols go unesterified.</span> </p><p><span m=''1084000''>So,
  cholesterol goes in here. In the cell, we want it esterified.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1090000''>When it''s in the package, it''s unesterified. So we have a</span>
  <span m=''1096000''>monolayer of phospholipids. We''ve got some protein stuck in</span>
  <span m=''1102000''>that monolayer, and it''s a very little particle.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1108000''>Now, these particles come in different flavors.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1114000''>These are very creative names: low-density lipoprotein</span> <span
  m=''1120000''>particles, or LDL. There are high density lipoprotein</span> <span
  m=''1129000''>particles, HDL, and very low density lipoprotein</span> <span m=''1141000''>particles,
  VLDL, and some other things called</span> <span m=''1148000''>kilomicrons. Now,
  you can imagine that these names</span> <span m=''1152000''>were assigned based
  on not so much information, just based on density,</span> <span m=''1156000''>right?
  Somebody was purifying lipoprotein particles and said,</span> <span m=''1159000''>well,
  there are some that are high density, low density,</span> <span m=''1163000''>oh,
  and you just discovered some very low density ones.</span> </p><p><span m=''1167000''>And
  this is not a highly informative description of these</span> <span m=''1171000''>particles,
  right? So, people later worked out that</span> <span m=''1175000''>these particles
  were really quite different, and particularly the</span> <span m=''1180000''>proteins
  that are in them, and those proteins turn out to have</span> <span m=''1186000''>important
  addressing roles in sending these particles to different</span> <span m=''1191000''>places.
  The ones that I''ll be interested in today are the LDL</span> <span m=''1196000''>particles.
  The LDL particles have a particular protein in them that is</span> <span m=''1202000''>called
  apoprotein B-100. It doesn''t matter,</span> <span m=''1208000''>but that''s the
  particular targeting protein there that''s in that.</span> </p><p><span m=''1214000''>And
  these particles are very large. They are about two and a half</span> <span m=''1221000''>million
  Daltons, about 220 angstroms in size,</span> <span m=''1227000''>and each of them
  contains about 1, 00 cholesterols.</span> </p><p><span m=''1234000''>That''s a description
  of these LDL particles, OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''1242000''>So, cholesterol, if
  it''s going to be transported in</span> <span m=''1251000''>the blood, gets packaged
  up into LDL particles, and it gets</span> <span m=''1259000''>sent off to cells.
  How does cholesterol get taken up by</span> <span m=''1266000''>cells from these
  LDL particles? How is that cell going to take up</span> <span m=''1271000''>an LDL
  particle: a receptor, right? It stands to reason that</span> <span m=''1276000''>there''s
  going to be a receptor that''s going to recognize probably</span> <span m=''1281000''>the
  protein on the surface of this thing that''ll recognize that and</span> <span m=''1286000''>internalize
  this particle. Now, this stands to reason to us to</span> <span m=''1291000''>you
  guys because you guys are highly sophisticated about all this.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1296000''>But how was it that people came to know this, to find these receptors?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1301000''>Well here is a little bit of an interesting story about
  how,</span> <span m=''1305000''>not so long ago, when people didn''t have all the
  tools in molecular</span> <span m=''1310000''>biology and all this? And very few
  of these cellular</span> <span m=''1315000''>receptors were known. Two young medical
  students began</span> <span m=''1320000''>studying a fascinating condition. The
  young medical students were</span> <span m=''1325000''>named Joe Goldstein and Mike
  Brown. And in fact, at least early in</span> <span m=''1330000''>their careers they
  were working here in Boston. So,</span> <span m=''1335000''>they studied a fascinating
  condition called familial hypercholesterolemia.</span> </p><p><span m=''1358000''>What
  does hypercholesterolemia mean? Cholesterol, hyper, a lot of</span> <span m=''1362000''>cholesterol,
  emia, in the blood, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1366000''>So, a lot of cholesterol
  in the blood was this condition.</span> </p><p><span m=''1370000''>And it was characterized,
  as you might guess, by the fact that</span> <span m=''1374000''>patients had a lot
  of cholesterol in the blood and that it was familial,</span> <span m=''1378000''>meaning
  what? It transmitted in families.</span> </p><p><span m=''1383000''>In fact, it
  transmitted in families like a Mendelian trait,</span> <span m=''1388000''>and it
  transmitted as an autosomal co-dominant trait.</span> </p><p><span m=''1393000''>In
  particular,</span> <span m=''1407000''>if we looked at most individuals in the population,</span>
  <span m=''1413000''>which we''ll assume have genotype plus over plus,</span> <span
  m=''1418000''>and we look at their cholesterol levels, what we find is maybe they</span>
  <span m=''1424000''>have 150 mg per desalude. Now, some people have higher</span>
  <span m=''1429000''>cholesterols than that, but I''m going to take that as an</span>
  <span m=''1435000''>average. Individuals who, by virtue of their genetics,</span>
  <span m=''1440000''>appear to be FH over plus heterozygotes would have</span> <span
  m=''1446000''>cholesterols more like 300 mg per desalude,</span> <span m=''1452000''>or
  about double the normal level. And, individuals who are FH</span> <span m=''1459000''>homozygotes,
  FH over FH based on the pedigree analysis here would have</span> <span m=''1467000''>greater
  than 600 milligrams per desalude.</span> </p><p><span m=''1475000''>In terms of
  heart attacks, normal individuals would have heart</span> <span m=''1480000''>attacks
  at the normal age. That doesn''t say anything,</span> <span m=''1485000''>does it,
  because the normal individuals, the age at which they</span> <span m=''1491000''>have
  heart attacks is defined as the normal age. But,</span> <span m=''1496000''>what
  you will know that''s striking is that individuals who are</span> <span m=''1501000''>heterozygotes
  would tend to have heart attacks 10-20 years earlier</span> <span m=''1507000''>than
  normal age. And, individuals who are homozygotes</span> <span m=''1513000''>would
  tend to have heart attacks below the age of 20.</span> </p><p><span m=''1519000''>So
  this might be heart attacks when you''re 60. This might be heart</span> <span m=''1526000''>attacks
  in your 40s and 50s, and this might be heart attacks in</span> <span m=''1532000''>your
  20s or teens. In addition, some of these</span> <span m=''1539000''>individuals
  have very big cholesterol deposits and things like</span> <span m=''1546000''>that.
  So, this was a very striking phenotype: simple Mendelian trait,</span> <span m=''1553000''>autosomal
  co-dominant, and to see teenagers or younger,</span> <span m=''1560000''>kids under
  the age of ten with massively occluded vessels,</span> <span m=''1565000''>and serious
  heart disease, and dying of heart attacks was very striking.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1570000''>So, Brown and Goldstein decided that if we wanted to understand</span>
  <span m=''1575000''>heart disease in the general population, we should understand</span>
  <span m=''1580000''>heart disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia,</span>
  <span m=''1586000''>particularly the homozygotes. Now, I note that this is about
  one per</span> <span m=''1591000''>one million individuals. And you could make a
  pretty strong</span> <span m=''1595000''>case that Brown and Goldstein are out of
  their minds trying to study</span> <span m=''1599000''>familial hypercholesterolemia
  at a frequency of one in a million and</span> <span m=''1603000''>try to imagine
  that that''s going to tell them about heart disease in the</span> <span m=''1607000''>general
  population. All right, and people made that</span> <span m=''1610000''>case to them
  and said, what are you doing? Let''s see,</span> <span m=''1614000''>if this is
  P2, that means the frequency of the,</span> <span m=''1618000''>Q2, the allele is
  one in a thousand in the population, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''1622000''>If
  one in a million people are homozygotes, the allele is one in 1,</span> <span m=''1625000''>00.
  And so, the heterozygote should be about one in 500.</span> </p><p><span m=''1629000''>Well,
  OK, so one in 500''s not a terrible, it''s not a small number.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1633000''>One in 500 people are heterozygotes for FH. That''s maybe a little</span>
  <span m=''1637000''>better, but still not even a percent. It''s a fifth of a percent
  of the</span> <span m=''1641000''>population are heterozygotes for FH. It''s still
  something of a gamble to</span> <span m=''1645000''>imagine that by studying this
  relatively rare disease we''re going</span> <span m=''1649000''>to learn about stuff
  in the general population.</span> </p><p><span m=''1653000''>But, Brown and Goldstein
  felt strongly that they would.</span> </p><p><span m=''1656000''>And they did. They
  wanted to know, what was the problem with these</span> <span m=''1659000''>individuals?
  Did they have problems synthesizing their LDL?</span> </p><p><span m=''1663000''>Did
  they have problems degrading LDL? Why was there so much LDL</span> <span m=''1666000''>cholesterol
  in the blood stream? Maybe they didn''t take up the LDL</span> <span m=''1670000''>from
  the blood stream. What was wrong? And so,</span> <span m=''1673000''>they studied
  just these individuals.</span> </p><p><span m=''1677000''>And what they found, to
  make an interesting and long</span> <span m=''1682000''>story short was that when
  they studied the binding of radioactive</span> <span m=''1687000''>LDL particles
  to cells from these patients, they found that the</span> <span m=''1693000''>homozygotes
  were virtually unable to take up LDL particles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1698000''>There
  was very low uptake of LDL particles. They also found that the</span> <span m=''1704000''>heterozygotes
  had only about half the normal uptake of LDL particles.</span> </p><p><span m=''1709000''>What''s
  your hypothesis about what the problem is? Sorry?</span> </p><p><span m=''1715000''>Well,
  it''s with the uptake, and what do you think the genetic</span> <span m=''1719000''>basis
  of this is? Yep? Well, let''s see,</span> <span m=''1723000''>if there''s zero in
  the homozygote, half the level in the heterozygote,</span> <span m=''1727000''>could
  be the receptor. And what could be the problem with receptor?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1731000''>Mutation of the receptor gene. What if homozygotes or FH had a</span>
  <span m=''1735000''>mutation that abolished the receptor?</span> </p><p><span m=''1740000''>OK,
  that turned out to be the case. Was the FH was due to mutations in</span> <span
  m=''1747000''>the LDL receptor on cells? And indeed, until this point,</span> <span
  m=''1755000''>the LDL receptor hadn''t been characterized on cells,</span> <span
  m=''1762000''>but by virtue of Brown and Goldstein demonstrating that when they
  did</span> <span m=''1770000''>radioactive labeled LDL uptake assays,</span> <span
  m=''1778000''>and they found that FH homozygotes had no uptake,</span> <span m=''1783000''>virtually
  no uptake, and that the heterozygotes had half</span> <span m=''1788000''>the normal
  level, and that the wild type individuals,</span> <span m=''1794000''>plus over
  plus, had the normal level, they inferred that the gene product</span> <span m=''1799000''>that
  was mutant in these individuals encoded the LDL receptor.</span> </p><p><span m=''1805000''>And
  they proceeded to clone this gene product, and determined that</span> <span m=''1810000''>the
  gene product encoded a protein that sat on the cell surface.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1816000''>It had a cytoplasmic tale. It had an extracellular tale,</span> <span
  m=''1821000''>and what it did was it bound to the apo B-100 protein on</span> <span
  m=''1827000''>the LDL particle. When it bound the cell made a little</span> <span
  m=''1834000''>pit, and in this coded pit, it came and internalized the LDL</span>
  <span m=''1842000''>receptor, carrying with it the LDL particle. And then,</span>
  <span m=''1850000''>this then went into the cell. The LDL particle was then degraded,</span>
  <span m=''1858000''>releasing cholesterol that could be used by the cell.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1866000''>And the receptor itself got recycled back to the surface
  to work another</span> <span m=''1870000''>day. And this is quite a general mechanism
  that is used there by a</span> <span m=''1875000''>lot of trafficking receptors
  like this that grab things from the cell</span> <span m=''1879000''>surface, bring
  them into the cell, release something into a vesicle,</span> <span m=''1884000''>and
  then go back onto the surface there, and that the problem was that</span> <span
  m=''1889000''>patients FH did not have functional LDL receptors.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''1894000''>Now, this pointed out, LDL receptors were very important</span> <span
  m=''1899000''>here because cells needed to take up cholesterol from the blood stream,</span>
  <span m=''1904000''>although they could make some of their own cholesterol.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''1909000''>But one of the most important places where cholesterol
  was</span> <span m=''1914000''>sequestered and taken up from the blood stream was
  the liver.</span> </p><p><span m=''1920000''>It turns out that the biggest problem
  for these patients with</span> <span m=''1929000''>familial hypercholesterolemia
  was that the liver is supposed to be</span> <span m=''1938000''>taking up large
  amounts of LDL to clear the blood stream and keep the</span> <span m=''1947000''>levels
  of LDL at the desirable amount. So, the liver normally is</span> <span m=''1956000''>responsible
  for taking up clearing about 75% of LDL from the blood.</span> </p><p><span m=''1965000''>If
  someone has, and other cells are responsible for</span> <span m=''1969000''>the
  rest, non-liver cells take up about 25% of the LDL.</span> </p><p><span m=''1973000''>Suppose
  somebody has half the level of LDL receptors,</span> <span m=''1977000''>they will
  take up half as much of these LDL particles,</span> <span m=''1981000''>and the
  average level in the blood would be much higher, about</span> <span m=''1985000''>twofold
  higher. Suppose somebody has no LDL</span> <span m=''1989000''>receptors. Well,
  then the LDL receptor pathway is not</span> <span m=''1992000''>going to take up
  these particles, and they''re going to have</span> <span m=''1996000''>outrageously
  high levels of LDL. Other mechanisms will kick in and</span> <span m=''1999000''>slightly
  prevent it from going to infinity, of course,</span> <span m=''2002000''>because
  there are other ways things get cleared out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2006000''>But
  they get huge levels of LDL because they have no</span> <span m=''2009000''>such
  receptors. So, this is the major reason that</span> <span m=''2013000''>there''s
  so much LDL cholesterol particles in the blood in these</span> <span m=''2017000''>patients
  who are FH homozygotes. And then, FH heterozygotes have a</span> <span m=''2022000''>lot.
  And, well, what are we going to do about it?</span> </p><p><span m=''2027000''>How
  do you solve a problem like this? The liver is not doing its</span> <span m=''2031000''>job.
  Now, I should note, the liver does one other thing.</span> </p><p><span m=''2036000''>the
  liver not only is the major source of taking cholesterol,</span> <span m=''2041000''>but
  it''s the major source of producing LDL cholesterol as well.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2046000''>The liver produces, I remember every cell is able to</span> <span
  m=''2050000''>synthesize cholesterol, but most of the cholesterol in the</span>
  <span m=''2054000''>body is synthesized from the liver and put out. And so,</span>
  <span m=''2058000''>here we have the liver is a source of cholesterol,</span> <span
  m=''2062000''>and it''s in this disease not acting as an appropriate sake for a</span>
  <span m=''2066000''>cholesterol. It ought to be sucking up cholesterol and maintaining
  a</span> <span m=''2070000''>balance of producing cholesterol and soaking it back
  up there.</span> </p><p><span m=''2074000''>We''ve got a real problem. Well, we
  need to know one more fact,</span> <span m=''2079000''>and then we can solve the
  disease. Well, we''re not going to solve the</span> <span m=''2085000''>disease,
  but we''ll do the best we can here. So,</span> <span m=''2090000''>cholesterol synthesis,
  I just want to tell you one more</span> <span m=''2096000''>fact about it and then
  toss you the problem. Cholesterol synthesis,</span> <span m=''2102000''>I said,
  was acetate, acetic acid, goes to stuff,</span> <span m=''2108000''>and let me tell
  you just a little bit more about it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2115000''>It goes to
  acetyl CO-A, which goes to HMG CO-A, which goes</span> <span m=''2121000''>to mevalonate,
  which goes on to make cholesterol,</span> <span m=''2128000''>and that the key committed
  step of cholesterol synthesis is carried out</span> <span m=''2135000''>by an enzyme
  called HMG CO-A reductase, OK?</span> </p><p><span m=''2142000''>Now you have all
  the facts. We know we''ve got these particles</span> <span m=''2148000''>that contain
  cholesterol. We understand that the liver makes</span> <span m=''2155000''>cholesterol,
  that you get cholesterol from your diet.</span> </p><p><span m=''2162000''>The liver
  makes cholesterol. It takes up cholesterol. We have</span> <span m=''2168000''>some
  problems with its uptake of cholesterol. Let''s get to work and</span> <span m=''2174000''>design
  a therapy. How are we going to do this?</span> </p><p><span m=''2180000''>So, we''ve
  got patients designing a rational therapy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2187000''>OK,
  here''s your digestive tract.</span> </p><p><span m=''2205000''>You''ve got some
  liver here it''s going to take up by</span> <span m=''2216000''>means of diet. It''s
  going to synthesize cholesterol.</span> </p><p><span m=''2226000''>It''s going to
  use cholesterol to make bile acids.</span> </p><p><span m=''2235000''>Those bile
  acids are going to help bring back fats because it''s going</span> <span m=''2244000''>to
  emulsify the fats. And so, the bile acids get recycled.</span> </p><p><span m=''2251000''>It''s
  going to put out cholesterol to the body, and LDL particles are</span> <span m=''2255000''>going
  to get internalized into the liver. So, we have our LDLs.</span> </p><p><span m=''2259000''>OK,
  so has everybody got the action? You take up a cholesterol,</span> <span m=''2263000''>and
  fats, and things like that through our diet.</span> </p><p><span m=''2268000''>You''ve
  got some cholesterol in our body. We synthesize cholesterol</span> <span m=''2272000''>from
  acetic acid. We have this pathway here.</span> </p><p><span m=''2276000''>We use
  cholesterol to make bile acids.</span> </p><p><span m=''2281000''>We take up cholesterol
  from the blood stream, and all of these</span> <span m=''2286000''>things together
  working as a system control how much cholesterol is in</span> <span m=''2291000''>your
  body, and most importantly, how much cholesterol''s in your blood</span> <span m=''2296000''>stream
  in the form of LDL particles. OK, we have a patient. Maybe it''s</span> <span m=''2301000''>a
  patient with FH homozygosity. But let''s start easier. Let''s</span> <span m=''2306000''>start
  with a patient who''s a heterozygote for FH.</span> </p><p><span m=''2312000''>What''s
  our first advice? Eat well, get plenty of exercise:</span> <span m=''2325000''>this
  is always good advice. So, plan one, so strategy number</span> <span m=''2338000''>one:
  diet, dietary reduction of cholesterol intake.</span> </p><p><span m=''2351000''>Eat
  less cholesterol. It''s a good bit of advice.</span> </p><p><span m=''2356000''>Stop
  eating eggs, whatever, you have a serious condition,</span> <span m=''2361000''>don''t
  eat so much better. Does it do much to reduce LDL levels?</span> </p><p><span m=''2366000''>It
  turns out, not much. Why doesn''t it do much?</span> </p><p><span m=''2371000''>What
  if I reduce dramatically my intake of cholesterol?</span> </p><p><span m=''2376000''>Well,
  it only makes about a 10% reduction in LDL levels,</span> <span m=''2380000''>which
  is not enough to get close to normal. Why? Well,</span> <span m=''2385000''>it turns
  out your body, number one, gets more efficient at</span> <span m=''2390000''>taking
  up cholesterol from your diet. So, you have some cholesterol there,</span> <span
  m=''2394000''>and if you''re eating less, it takes up with higher efficiency</span>
  <span m=''2399000''>the cholesterol that''s there. Your body''s good at doing things</span>
  <span m=''2403000''>like that. It also starts synthesizing cholesterol.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2406000''>Don''t have enough cholesterol? We''ll make more cholesterol. So,</span>
  <span m=''2410000''>the liver will make more cholesterol, put cholesterol out into
  the blood</span> <span m=''2413000''>stream, and these guys can''t take up the cholesterol
  with the LDL</span> <span m=''2416000''>receptor as well, and it clogs it up again.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2419000''>So in the end, between more efficient uptake of what
  is in the</span> <span m=''2422000''>diet and greater synthesis, we''ve got to complex
  the human</span> <span m=''2426000''>system with feedback, and all you''ve tried
  to do is affect</span> <span m=''2429000''>one variable, dietary intake. And the
  system regulates so that you</span> <span m=''2434000''>haven''t made a very big
  dent in the problem. All right,</span> <span m=''2441000''>next strategy, let''s
  try to deplete some cholesterol from the body.</span> </p><p><span m=''2449000''>If
  we could get some cholesterol out of the body by some pathway,</span> <span m=''2456000''>we
  might be able to decrease the overall levels of cholesterol.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2464000''>So, where do we have access to a cholesterol product here?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2468000''>In the digestive system, we have bile acids. Got any
  ideas of what</span> <span m=''2473000''>we could do about the bile acids? Suppose
  we could somehow deplete</span> <span m=''2478000''>your bile acids while they''re
  in your digestive tract.</span> </p><p><span m=''2483000''>Then your body would
  not be able to recycle those bile acids,</span> <span m=''2488000''>but would have
  to make more bile acids. And it would be a sink for</span> <span m=''2493000''>cholesterol,
  right? It would start having to use up more</span> <span m=''2498000''>cholesterol
  to produce enough bile acids because it would have to use</span> <span m=''2502000''>up
  more cholesterol. The liver might have to work harder</span> <span m=''2506000''>to
  get cholesterol, you know, synthesizing cholesterol,</span> <span m=''2511000''>but
  it would also probably up regulate its LDL receptors to try to</span> <span m=''2515000''>draw
  in more cholesterol from the blood stream.</span> </p><p><span m=''2520000''>So,
  this was the clever idea. Let''s try to get ride of bile acids,</span> <span m=''2524000''>or
  not completely rid of them, but let''s try to complete bile acids.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2528000''>Therefore, the liver is going to not be able to reuse them.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2532000''>It''s going to have to make more bile acids. It''s going
  to need</span> <span m=''2537000''>cholesterol. And so it''s going to up regulate
  the gene for LDL</span> <span m=''2541000''>receptors and draw in more from the
  blood stream. It turns out that you</span> <span m=''2545000''>can feed people bile
  acid binding resins. It''s perfectly fine.</span> </p><p><span m=''2549000''>Just
  eat them, and you can give people bile acid binding resins.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2554000''>So, strategy number two, and what they will do is then they</span>
  <span m=''2561000''>will, in their feces, eliminate some fraction of the bile</span>
  <span m=''2569000''>acids and as a result they will be able to get rid of some of
  their</span> <span m=''2576000''>cholesterol, and they will be able to decrease
  their overall</span> <span m=''2584000''>cholesterol levels. Does this work?</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2594000''>It does, and you can get maybe a 20-25% reduction. But</span>
  <span m=''2608000''>what''s the problem? You can''t completely get rid of them,</span>
  <span m=''2617000''>right, because they''re necessary. So, we''ll be able to get
  rid of</span> <span m=''2621000''>some bile acids. That''s really the problem is,</span>
  <span m=''2626000''>see, we''re sitting here saying so cleverly we''re going to
  feed the</span> <span m=''2630000''>body less cholesterol. We''re going to draw
  cholesterol out</span> <span m=''2635000''>of the body by removing bile acids, and
  force the liver to take up more</span> <span m=''2639000''>cholesterol from the
  blood stream, right?</span> </p><p><span m=''2644000''>And hopefully it''ll help
  regulate the gene. And it does help regulate</span> <span m=''2647000''>the gene.
  When starved for cholesterol, cells up regulate their</span> <span m=''2650000''>LDL
  receptor gene and make more LDL receptors. That works.</span> </p><p><span m=''2653000''>But
  we''ve forgotten one aspect of the system, and that was the liver</span> <span m=''2656000''>has
  another option, which was synthesize its own</span> <span m=''2659000''>cholesterol.
  So, we''ve got a complex system with</span> <span m=''2662000''>multiple feedbacks.
  We''ve affected it at the level of</span> <span m=''2665000''>diet. We''ve affected
  at the level here of drawing stuff out.</span> </p><p><span m=''2668000''>We''ve
  managed to get some up regulation the LDL receptor gene.</span> </p><p><span m=''2672000''>But
  it''s not enough because the liver''s choosing to make more</span> <span m=''2678000''>cholesterol
  through its endogenous synthesis pathway.</span> </p><p><span m=''2685000''>So,
  let''s keep going. What do you recommend?</span> </p><p><span m=''2691000''>Yes?
  Ooh, ooh, I like that. What do you think will happen then?</span> </p><p><span m=''2698000''>So,
  I won''t make as much cholesterol. What''s the liver going to have to</span> <span
  m=''2702000''>do then? And it will up regulate its LDL receptors to do that,</span>
  <span m=''2706000''>take up more cholesterol from the blood stream. So now,</span>
  <span m=''2710000''>we back the liver into a corner, right? It needs more cholesterol.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2714000''>We''re going to inhibit the synthesis of cholesterol,</span>
  <span m=''2718000''>and therefore it''s going to go to its second source,</span>
  <span m=''2722000''>which is uptake from the blood, and it''s going to induce more
  LDL</span> <span m=''2726000''>reception. Everybody got your plan? So, let''s see.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2730000''>Strategy would be inhibit cholesterol synthesis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2736000''>This is in addition also inhibit cholesterol synthesis.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2742000''>And, you wanted to inhibit one of those steps. Any preference
  of</span> <span m=''2748000''>where you''d like to inhibit the step? How about the
  first committed step</span> <span m=''2754000''>of cholesterol synthesis? So, how
  about H, M, G, CO-A</span> <span m=''2760000''>reductase inhibitors?</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2775000''>Well, it turns out that people found HMG CO-A reductase inhibitors.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2779000''>Lovastatin, a fungal product inhibits HMG CO-A reductase.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2783000''>And then, companies, Merck and then many other companies,</span>
  <span m=''2787000''>developed all sorts of what are called statin drugs that</span>
  <span m=''2791000''>inhibit that enzyme. I would venture to say that a large</span>
  <span m=''2795000''>fraction of your parents take statin drugs to lower cholesterol.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2799000''>And this is how it works. It inhibits the endogenous
  synthesis</span> <span m=''2804000''>pathway at the step HMG CO-A reductase. And,</span>
  <span m=''2808000''>in addition, if they do things like take bile acid binding resins,</span>
  <span m=''2813000''>and there''s some combinations of those things, and also controlled</span>
  <span m=''2818000''>your dietary intake of cholesterol, and FH heterozygote can
  get a 60%</span> <span m=''2822000''>reduction in LDL particle loss. That is mighty
  good.</span> </p><p><span m=''2827000''>That brings them down to normal. Yeah? Yeah?
  Yep. So we''re not</span> <span m=''2832000''>talking about totally removing it.
  We''re talking about decreasing it.</span> </p><p><span m=''2837000''>We''re bringing
  it back down to a normal level. Well,</span> <span m=''2842000''>it turns out that
  the cells out there will up regulate their LDL</span> <span m=''2847000''>receptors
  as well, and I haven''t focused on that.</span> </p><p><span m=''2853000''>But they''re
  taking care of themselves. It turns out,</span> <span m=''2856000''>you have to
  worry about all these strategies. This is too clever by</span> <span m=''2859000''>half
  because you''re going to mess up things in the periphery.</span> </p><p><span m=''2862000''>But
  it turns out the peripheral cells take care of themselves.</span> </p><p><span m=''2865000''>They''ll
  up regulate their LDL receptors enough to get things in.</span> </p><p><span m=''2869000''>And
  the big problem is that the liver''s not doing its job.</span> </p><p><span m=''2872000''>But
  you have to do the clinical tests to see that that''s the case.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2875000''>This turns out to be a strategy for FH heterozygotes.</span> </p><p><span
  m=''2878000''>But I just said that many of your parents take these drugs.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2882000''>Most of your parents aren''t FH heterozygotes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2885000''>Perhaps none of your parents are FH heterozygotes.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''2889000''>That turned out to be one of the most remarkable outcomes
  of studying</span> <span m=''2892000''>this rare genetic disease. Well, as it turned
  out, this</span> <span m=''2896000''>strategy, which had been the understanding
  that had been</span> <span m=''2899000''>developed from this exceedingly rare genetic
  disease,</span> <span m=''2903000''>and the strategy that had been developed with
  an eye towards these</span> <span m=''2906000''>FH heterozygotes turns out to also
  work in normal individuals with high</span> <span m=''2910000''>cholesterol not
  because of a complete mutation in the LDL</span> <span m=''2913000''>receptor, but
  because of, perhaps, other differences,</span> <span m=''2917000''>genetic differences
  that are weaker. And in fact, tens of millions of</span> <span m=''2920000''>people
  take these therapies that were developed for this very rare</span> <span m=''2924000''>situation.
  This is a perfect example of where understanding a</span> <span m=''2927000''>rare
  genetic disease points us to the basis for a physiological</span> <span m=''2931000''>pathway,
  in particular, all these feedback loops that allow</span> <span m=''2934000''>us
  to do something that helps everybody. So,</span> <span m=''2938000''>this has become
  a major, major therapy.</span> </p><p><span m=''2942000''>Who were the only people
  who don''t benefit from this particular therapy</span> <span m=''2946000''>of tricking
  the body into up regulating the LDL receptors?</span> </p><p><span m=''2950000''>Homozygotes,
  because they don''t have a gene to be up regulated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2955000''>They
  don''t have a functional gene to be up regulated.</span> </p><p><span m=''2959000''>And
  so, homozygotes need something else. What do they need?</span> </p><p><span m=''2964000''>Gene
  therapy. The best idea that people have here since the liver</span> <span m=''2968000''>regenerates
  tremendously would be able to take out some liver cells,</span> <span m=''2973000''>add
  back genes for LDL receptors, and repopulate a liver with LDL</span> <span m=''2977000''>receptor
  transgenic cells. And that would help them.</span> </p><p><span m=''2982000''>Anyway,
  this is meant to illustrate the power of rational therapy,</span> <span m=''2986000''>that
  understanding things, can you imagine trying to do this by hit or</span> <span m=''2991000''>miss?
  It was your design knowing the pieces that God is here,</span> <span m=''2995000''>and
  this is basically what we''re trying to do with all of medicine is</span> <span
  m=''3000000''>get to the point where we can design things that really do work.</span>
  </p><p><span m=''3004000''>See you next time.</span> </p>'
