transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>Thanksgivings. We're talking today about rational</span>\
  \ <span m='5000'>medicine, and really what we're talking about is an understanding\
  \ of</span> <span m='10000'>the molecular biology of disease has actually helped\
  \ to revolutionize the</span> <span m='16000'>new science of therapeutic medicine.\
  \ And here, more often than not, the</span> <span m='21000'>discussions are focused\
  \ around cancer. And so,</span> <span m='27000'>I will therefore talk about an interesting\
  \ story,</span> <span m='32000'>vis-\xE0-vis the modern treatment of cancer, and\
  \ how our understanding of</span> <span m='37000'>the molecular biology of the disease\
  \ really helps in developing radically</span> <span m='43000'>new kinds of therapies.\
  \ By way of background,</span> <span m='48000'>let's just mention that most of the\
  \ chemotherapeutics that we use today</span> <span m='53000'>to treat cancer were\
  \ developed over the last 40-50 years at a time when</span> <span m='58000'>the\
  \ molecular and biochemical defects inside cancer cells</span> <span m='63000'>were\
  \ totally obscure. And therefore,</span> <span m='67000'>to the extent that one\
  \ developed chemotherapeutics,</span> <span m='71000'>they were developed simply\
  \ empirically, trial and error.</span> </p><p><span m='74000'>For example, some\
  \ of the most effective chemotherapeutics against</span> <span m='78000'>childhood\
  \ leukemia are alkylating agents,</span> <span m='82000'>which attach methyl and\
  \ ethyl groups</span> <span m='90000'>to target molecules inside cells. And their\
  \ utility in cancer was</span> <span m='95000'>first discerned because of an explosion\
  \ in a container.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>I think it was in a ship off Naples\
  \ in World War II where a bin of</span> <span m='106000'>alkylating agents was dispersed.\
  \ Many people were exposed to it, and</span> <span m='111000'>these people, as a\
  \ consequence of that, came down with what's</span> <span m='117000'>called leucopoenia.\
  \ Poenia generally means a depression,</span> <span m='122000'>in this case, a depression\
  \ of their white blood cells.</span> </p><p><span m='127000'>Such alkylating agents\
  \ had actually been used during the First World War</span> <span m='132000'>in gas\
  \ warfare because during the First World War,</span> <span m='137000'>one used so-called\
  \ mustard gases, which was a very effective way, even</span> <span m='142000'>more\
  \ effective than artillery in killing vast numbers</span> <span m='147000'>of enemy\
  \ soldiers. And, somebody noticed this</span> <span m='152000'>leucopoenia in 1946-47\
  \ as a consequence of inadvertent exposure</span> <span m='156000'>to these alkylating\
  \ agents, which became dispersed as a gas.</span> </p><p><span m='161000'>And about\
  \ five years later, somebody made the logical leap that</span> <span m='165000'>if\
  \ these agents were able to suppress normal white blood</span> <span m='169000'>concentrations\
  \ that perhaps they might also be effective against what</span> <span m='174000'>seemed\
  \ to be ostensibly a related problem, which is the problem</span> <span m='178000'>of\
  \ leukemia. And keep in mind that when we talk</span> <span m='183000'>about leukemia,\
  \ the suffix -emia refers to blood</span> <span m='188000'>generally, and leuk-\
  \ once again refers to white blood,</span> <span m='193000'>i.e. an excess of white\
  \ blood cells in the blood. And so,</span> <span m='198000'>through this accidental\
  \ discovery, one began to develop alkylating</span> <span m='202000'>agents that\
  \ turned out to be extremely successful in treating,</span> <span m='207000'>and\
  \ often curing, childhood leukemias, most notably acute</span> <span m='212000'>lymphocytic\
  \ leukemia, which turns out to be very sensitive</span> <span m='217000'>to this\
  \ and other related agents. So, this is a very common form of</span> <span m='222000'>childhood\
  \ leukemia, which is now actually cured in 60 or</span> <span m='226000'>70% of\
  \ the children who were treated, which would have been unheard of</span> <span m='230000'>half\
  \ a century ago. But I return to what I said before,</span> <span m='235000'>which\
  \ is that this kind of treatment was developed in the face of total</span> <span\
  \ m='239000'>ignorance concerning the nature of the disease, the molecular defects</span>\
  \ <span m='244000'>that were present in the disease, and that were responsible for\
  \ the</span> <span m='248000'>runaway, can you still hear me OK, were responsible\
  \ for the runaway</span> <span m='252000'>proliferation of the cancer cells. So\
  \ having said that,</span> <span m='257000'>I want to go to a different kind of\
  \ leukemia, and this is called chronic</span> <span m='262000'>myelogenous leukemia,\
  \ to give you an indication of the</span> <span m='268000'>path of discovery that\
  \ led from its original description to the</span> <span m='273000'>development of\
  \ rather successful treatments.</span> </p><p><span m='279000'>So, chronic myelogenous\
  \ leukemia, I mentioned the prefix myelo- last</span> <span m='285000'>time or the\
  \ time before referring to bone marrow, and this is a leukemia</span> <span m='291000'>of\
  \ cells coming from the bone marrow from the myeloid cells in the bone</span> <span\
  \ m='297000'>marrow, which are the precursors of things like macrophages</span>\
  \ <span m='303000'>and granulocytes. So, these are cells which are</span> <span\
  \ m='308000'>playing an important role in the immune response,</span> <span m='312000'>and\
  \ during this chronic myelogenous leukemia disease,</span> <span m='316000'>which\
  \ is called CML, there could be a period of three or</span> <span m='321000'>four\
  \ years where individuals develop large numbers of these cells in</span> <span m='325000'>their\
  \ blood stream. And after a period of about three or</span> <span m='330000'>four\
  \ years, all of a sudden there is an eruption into what's called blast</span> <span\
  \ m='334000'>crisis. And you may recall I mentioned the word blast also on one</span>\
  \ <span m='338000'>occasion earlier. This all fits together in a nice</span> <span\
  \ m='342000'>puzzle. Blast refers to primitive, embryonic-like cells, and all of\
  \ a</span> <span m='346000'>sudden there is an eruption of primitive, embryonic-like\
  \ cells,</span> <span m='350000'>less differentiated like these macrophages and\
  \ granulocytes,</span> <span m='354000'>which until this point had been present\
  \ in vastly excessive numbers</span> <span m='358000'>in the blood. There's blast\
  \ crisis.</span> </p><p><span m='363000'>This leads to acute myelogenous leukemia,\
  \ and death ensues usually</span> <span m='368000'>within a year or two, or that's\
  \ been traditionally the</span> <span m='373000'>case. No one really had any idea\
  \ about the possible causative</span> <span m='377000'>mechanisms of the disease,\
  \ and that allows me to use another</span> <span m='382000'>word which you might\
  \ one day come across if you should stay in</span> <span m='387000'>biomedical research.\
  \ And that is the etiologic agents.</span> </p><p><span m='392000'>When we talk\
  \ about etiologic agents, we talk about the agents which are</span> <span m='397000'>causally\
  \ responsible for inducing a disease. These can be external</span> <span m='401000'>agents,\
  \ or they could even be internal agents,</span> <span m='406000'>molecules inside\
  \ cells which are responsible for the creation of the</span> <span m='411000'>disease.\
  \ And the key discovery was made in 1960 when individuals were</span> <span m='416000'>looking\
  \ at the chromosomal makeup of the CML cells.</span> </p><p><span m='421000'>The\
  \ chromosomal makeup, I'll use another word just so we</span> <span m='425000'>could\
  \ expand our vocabulary this morning, the chromosomal makeup is</span> <span m='429000'>often\
  \ called the karyotype, that is to say the constellation of</span> <span m='434000'>chromosomes\
  \ that one can see at mitosis under the microscope.</span> </p><p><span m='438000'>Keep\
  \ in mind, as we've said before, that during the interphase of the</span> <span\
  \ m='442000'>cell cycle, chromosomes are essentially invisible,</span> <span m='447000'>but\
  \ during the metaphase of mitosis they become condensed,</span> <span m='451000'>and\
  \ on that occasion, individuals noticed a 9-22 translocation.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='456000'>So here is chromosome nine normally. Here's chromosome 22. And as you</span>\
  \ <span m='461000'>may know, the numbering system with human chromosomes goes from\
  \ the</span> <span m='466000'>largest number one all the way down to the smallest.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='471000'>So, this is the smallest, with the exception of the Y</span>\
  \ <span m='477000'>chromosome. And what they notice was instead of</span> <span\
  \ m='481000'>seeing this regular chromosomal array, they noticed instead what</span>\
  \ <span m='484000'>looked very much like a structure of this sort here, i.e.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='487000'>a translocation.</span> </p><p><span m='515000'>And this\
  \ translocation resulted in a swapping of sequences between these</span> <span m='519000'>two\
  \ chromosomes. Note, by the way,</span> <span m='523000'>this is reciprocal, i.e.\
  \ in the sense that nine donates</span> <span m='527000'>something to 22, and 22\
  \ donates something to nine.</span> </p><p><span m='531000'>However, the segments\
  \ that are swapped are not necessarily of equal</span> <span m='535000'>size. So,\
  \ it turns out here that in this case, chromosome nine has</span> <span m='539000'>actually\
  \ gained a lot more than chromosome 22 gained as a</span> <span m='543000'>consequence\
  \ of this exchange of genetic segments.</span> </p><p><span m='548000'>And this\
  \ 9-22 translocation made the smallest chromosome even smaller.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='552000'>So, this was already the smallest chromosome as I mentioned besides</span>\
  \ <span m='556000'>the smallest autosome, the smallest non-sex chromosome.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='560000'>Now it got even smaller because it lost some of its bulk\
  \ as a</span> <span m='564000'>consequence of this chromosomal translocation.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='569000'>And because this discovery was made in Philadelphia,</span>\
  \ <span m='573000'>it became known as the Philadelphia chromosome. This is now about\
  \ 40</span> <span m='577000'>years ago, or as it's sometimes called, PH-1 for reasons,</span>\
  \ <span m='582000'>I don't know why it's called PH-1 except for Philadelphia.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='586000'>And, as investigators began to look at other cases of\
  \ chronic</span> <span m='591000'>myelogenous leukemia, they discovered that this</span>\
  \ <span m='595000'>translocation was present at the Philadelphia chromosome most</span>\
  \ <span m='600000'>importantly was identifiable in virtually all cases,</span> <span\
  \ m='604000'>more than 95% of the cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='609000'>And moreover, this chromosome was present as well in the\
  \ more</span> <span m='613000'>differentiated macrophages and granulocytes that\
  \ were present and</span> <span m='618000'>circulating in the blood of the CML patients.\
  \ And that began to suggest</span> <span m='622000'>the notion that there was a\
  \ stem cell of some sort,</span> <span m='627000'>oligopotential stem cell that\
  \ created various kinds of more</span> <span m='631000'>differentiated white blood\
  \ cells that had sustained this chromosomal</span> <span m='636000'>translocation\
  \ because that's what it is, a translocalization,</span> <span m='641000'>a translocation,\
  \ that all the cells of these patients had sustained this</span> <span m='646000'>chromosomal\
  \ translocation. And that began to suggest the</span> <span m='651000'>notion that\
  \ somehow as a consequence of a random genetic accident</span> <span m='656000'>happening\
  \ in these people's blood, this particular chromosome was</span> <span m='661000'>repeatedly\
  \ identified. And it was with great likelihood</span> <span m='667000'>causally\
  \ or etiologically important in the genesis of the disease.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='673000'>But that in itself led nowhere. One could simply talk about its</span>\
  \ <span m='680000'>association until work from a totally unrelated area,</span>\
  \ <span m='687000'>which is to say the study of retroviruses discovered Abelson</span>\
  \ <span m='693000'>murine leukemia virus. And Abelson was named after the</span>\
  \ <span m='699000'>fellow, Herb Abelson, who first discovered it at NIH and</span>\
  \ <span m='704000'>undertook its molecular characterization here in our own</span>\
  \ <span m='708000'>cancer center, and Abelson discovered that this</span> <span\
  \ m='713000'>virus which he studied carried the ends of the murine leukemia virus,</span>\
  \ <span m='718000'>which was a parental virus. It was as hybrid virus.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='723000'>And into the middle of it, Abelson leukemia virus has acquired</span>\
  \ <span m='728000'>a cellular proto-oncogene, which it had activated into an</span>\
  \ <span m='733000'>oncogene. And therefore, here we have a situation where a</span>\
  \ <span m='738000'>cellular gene like sarc in the case of Rous Sarcoma Virus has\
  \ been</span> <span m='743000'>activated. This became called ABL for obvious reasons.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='748000'>And this gene, it turned out, was critically important\
  \ in</span> <span m='753000'>understanding hwo the chromosomal translocation led\
  \ to cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>In fact, if one infected mice with a\
  \ retrovirus carrying this genome,</span> <span m='763000'>this is just to indicate\
  \ the fact that the repeat ends,</span> <span m='768000'>the long terminal repeat\
  \ ends of this provirus,</span> <span m='773000'>they occur twice at the ends of\
  \ this retrovirus. If one infected a mouse</span> <span m='778000'>with the Abelson\
  \ virus, out came a disease which was</span> <span m='783000'>superficially similar\
  \ at least to chronic myelogenous leukemia.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>And that\
  \ began a search, then, for the chromosomal</span> <span m='793000'>localization\
  \ of the Abel proto-oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='798000'>And what was discovered\
  \ subsequently, fascinatingly enough,</span> <span m='803000'>was that the Abel\
  \ proto-oncogene was right at the break point between two</span> <span m='809000'>chromosomes,\
  \ nine and 22. And what happened as a consequence</span> <span m='814000'>of this\
  \ translocation, and the resulting fusion of this</span> <span m='818000'>chromosome\
  \ with this chromosome was the creation of a fuse gene,</span> <span m='822000'>a\
  \ hybrid gene that now carried the reading frames of two previously</span> <span\
  \ m='826000'>unconnected gene, one on chromosome nine,</span> <span m='830000'>and\
  \ one on chromosome 22. Here's the normal, Abel protein.</span> </p><p><span m='834000'>It's\
  \ called C Abel, meaning the cellular or the normal form of Abel.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='838000'>And you see it up here. It's shown in a very schematic way.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='842000'>And here's a second protein which is encoded on the other\
  \ chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='846000'>So, Abel is encoded here, and the other\
  \ gene, which is called BCR is</span> <span m='851000'>encoded here, and as a consequence\
  \ of the translocation,</span> <span m='855000'>Abel is encoded here. BCR is encoded\
  \ here. As a consequence of</span> <span m='859000'>the translocation, one now has\
  \ not only the fusion of</span> <span m='864000'>chromosomal segments. But one has\
  \ the fusion of the</span> <span m='868000'>reading frames of two previously unlinked\
  \ genes.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>And here, one creates as a consequence of\
  \ these fusions,</span> <span m='878000'>any one of a series of three quite distinct\
  \ fusion proteins,</span> <span m='883000'>which do not naturally preexist in the\
  \ normal cell.</span> </p><p><span m='888000'>And there shown here is P-1 85, P-2\
  \ 10, and P-2 30. These</span> <span m='893000'>translocations allow different parts\
  \ of a second gene called BCR.</span> </p><p><span m='898000'>BCR refers to breakpoint\
  \ cluster region. The area of the point of</span> <span m='902000'>fusion is called\
  \ the breakpoint between the two genes.</span> </p><p><span m='906000'>So, the point\
  \ where each gene is cut and fused with the other is</span> <span m='910000'>called\
  \ the breakpoint. And it turns out that within the</span> <span m='914000'>region\
  \ of the chromosome where BCR maps, there's actually three sites</span> <span m='918000'>at\
  \ which the fusion can occur. If you look carefully at this</span> <span m='922000'>diagram,\
  \ you see that there's differing extents of the BCR protein,</span> <span m='926000'>which\
  \ can be contributed to the fusion protein.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>And,\
  \ what this says, in effect, is the following,</span> <span m='935000'>that here,\
  \ let's just refer to this diagram right up here.</span> </p><p><span m='940000'>Notice,\
  \ by the way, in all three of these, that the Abel protein is</span> <span m='946000'>present\
  \ at the C terminal end of the protein. The BCR is present at the</span> <span m='951000'>end\
  \ terminal end. So, here's the BCR gene.</span> </p><p><span m='957000'>Here's the\
  \ Abel gene down here. And what investigators found is that</span> <span m='961000'>there\
  \ could be a break at this part of the BCR gene,</span> <span m='965000'>at this\
  \ part of the BCR gene, or at this part of the BCR gene,</span> <span m='969000'>resulting\
  \ always in the fusion of Abel, to one, or two,</span> <span m='973000'>or three\
  \ different kinds of BCR proteins. And,</span> <span m='977000'>breakpoint cluster\
  \ region signified the fact that there was a whole</span> <span m='981000'>cluster\
  \ of sites in the previously existing BCR gene to which this</span> <span m='985000'>fusion\
  \ could take place, resulting, if the break occurred</span> <span m='989000'>here,\
  \ the breakpoint occurred here, and BCR to get the longer one.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='993000'>Here you get the medium-sized one; here you'd get the shortest one.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='997000'>And, interestingly enough, as one explored virtually,</span>\
  \ <span m='1001000'>other kinds of different leukemias, one could see different\
  \ of these</span> <span m='1005000'>fusion proteins that were produced. Here's chronic,\
  \ myelogenous</span> <span m='1009000'>leukemia, which I talked to you about before.\
  \ Here is acute</span> <span m='1013000'>lymphocytic leukemia, and here's chronic\
  \ and neutrophylic</span> <span m='1017000'>leukemia, three different kinds of leukemia.\
  \ We don't have to worry</span> <span m='1021000'>about the details of these diseases,\
  \ aside from the fact to say that the</span> <span m='1025000'>structure of this\
  \ fusion protein encourages the outgrowth of</span> <span m='1029000'>different\
  \ kinds of stem cells in the bone marrow, which in turn create</span> <span m='1033000'>three\
  \ different kinds of diseases. Most importantly for our discussion</span> <span\
  \ m='1037000'>was an attempt to understand the nature of the resulting fusion</span>\
  \ <span m='1041000'>protein, which as a consequence of this fusion caused by the</span>\
  \ <span m='1045000'>chromosomal translocation now clearly acquired biological powers</span>\
  \ <span m='1049000'>that did not preexist in either of the two parental proteins.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1053000'>These various notations here indicate a whole series\
  \ of different</span> <span m='1057000'>functions which are associated with the\
  \ Abel protein,</span> <span m='1061000'>and alternatively with the BCR protein.\
  \ And we don't need to get</span> <span m='1065000'>into them, except to say that\
  \ each one of these different names here</span> <span m='1069000'>allows the protein\
  \ on its own to associate with other proteins and do</span> <span m='1073000'>activated\
  \ downstream signaling cascade.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>What's most important\
  \ about our discussion is the realization that</span> <span m='1083000'>this SH-1\
  \ domain, indicated here, SH-1 refers to the</span> <span m='1089000'>sarcomology\
  \ domain, equals sarcomology, equals a</span> <span m='1095000'>tyrosine kinase.\
  \ And therefore, what one has here is</span> <span m='1101000'>a protein, which\
  \ is much more elaborate than sarc,</span> <span m='1107000'>has vastly more signaling\
  \ capabilities,</span> <span m='1113000'>by virtue of the fact that these different\
  \ domains that are indicated</span> <span m='1117000'>here allow the resulting fusion\
  \ protein to grab hold of a whole</span> <span m='1122000'>bunch of different signally\
  \ partners so that it can send out a diverse</span> <span m='1127000'>array of downstream\
  \ activating signals. If one examined the</span> <span m='1132000'>structure of\
  \ the SH-1 domain, it had a tyrosine kinase activity</span> <span m='1137000'>very\
  \ much like sarc, and most importantly,</span> <span m='1142000'>if one introduced\
  \ this fusion protein into a retrovirus,</span> <span m='1147000'>now instead of\
  \ Abel, one could make a BCR Abel fusion protein.</span> </p><p><span m='1152000'>One\
  \ could put this into a retrovirus as before, just like up here.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1156000'>One could infect mice with it, and now get out of a disease which</span>\
  \ <span m='1161000'>was indistinguishable, in essence, from chronic myelogenous</span>\
  \ <span m='1165000'>leukemia in humans. If one put a subtle point mutation</span>\
  \ <span m='1170000'>in the tyrosine kinase domain, all of the able protein, here\
  \ is the</span> <span m='1174000'>tyrosine kinase domain, SH-1, up here. Here, we\
  \ see the</span> <span m='1178000'>tyrosine kinase domains represented in the three\
  \ different fusion</span> <span m='1183000'>proteins. Keep in mind SH-1 is always\
  \ the tyrosine kinase domain.</span> </p><p><span m='1187000'>If one put a subtle,\
  \ inactivating point mutation in the tyrosine</span> <span m='1191000'>kinase domain,\
  \ that immediately wiped out all</span> <span m='1196000'>biological powers of creating\
  \ leukemias on the part of this</span> <span m='1200000'>retrovirus here, or any\
  \ one of the other closely</span> <span m='1204000'>related kinds of fusion proteins.\
  \ And therefore,</span> <span m='1209000'>that indicated that the tyrosine kinase\
  \ domain indicated right here</span> <span m='1213000'>was really critical to creating\
  \ the tumor, and that any effects on its</span> <span m='1217000'>tyrosine kinase\
  \ signaling ability would, in the end,</span> <span m='1221000'>result in the collapse\
  \ of the tumor, or the inability of the resulting</span> <span m='1225000'>retrovirus\
  \ to actually create cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>And so, now one had,\
  \ really for the first time,</span> <span m='1234000'>a clear demonstration of how\
  \ a commonly occurring human cancer,</span> <span m='1238000'>chronic myelogenous\
  \ leukemia, is unfortunately not so rare,</span> <span m='1242000'>could arise as\
  \ a consequence of some random, chromosomal translocation</span> <span m='1246000'>event.\
  \ You might ask, why does one always get this</span> <span m='1250000'>particular\
  \ kind of translocation? Well, the answer is, we don't</span> <span m='1254000'>really\
  \ know. It would almost seem as if there's a homing device which</span> <span m='1258000'>causes\
  \ this fragment and this fragment to target each other and to</span> <span m='1262000'>exchange\
  \ one another. It's probably not the case.</span> </p><p><span m='1267000'>What\
  \ probably happens is that chromosomal translocations take</span> <span m='1271000'>place\
  \ rather randomly within the bone marrow, and on rare occasion</span> <span m='1275000'>there\
  \ is a chromosomal translocation that creates exactly this kind of</span> <span\
  \ m='1279000'>fusion. And this kind of fusion, in turn, is what's responsible for</span>\
  \ <span m='1283000'>creating this fusion protein, and this fusion protein in turn</span>\
  \ <span m='1287000'>creates the outgrowth of this CML, the chronic myelogenous leukemia</span>\
  \ <span m='1291000'>disease. So what that means is really that a</span> <span m='1296000'>randomly\
  \ occurring chromosomal translocation on rare occasion hits</span> <span m='1300000'>a\
  \ genetic jackpot, and the cell which happens to have</span> <span m='1304000'>acquired\
  \ this kind of chromosomal translocation now begins to</span> <span m='1308000'>proliferate\
  \ wildly, creating first chronic myelogenous</span> <span m='1312000'>leukemia,\
  \ and then subsequently erupting into a subsequent acute</span> <span m='1316000'>phase\
  \ where there are seemingly additional genetic alterations</span> <span m='1320000'>beyond\
  \ this chromosomal translocation that conspire with the</span> <span m='1324000'>initially\
  \ present chromosomal translocation to create a very</span> <span m='1328000'>aggressive\
  \ disease which rapidly leads to the death of the</span> <span m='1332000'>leukemia\
  \ patient. That offered, in principle,</span> <span m='1336000'>an attractive way\
  \ of beginning to develop an anti-cancer therapeutic</span> <span m='1341000'>because\
  \ what one might imagine was that one could develop a tyrosine</span> <span m='1346000'>kinase\
  \ inhibitor.</span> </p><p><span m='1358000'>Now keep in mind that tyrosine kinases\
  \ are a class of enzymes which</span> <span m='1362000'>attach phosphate groups\
  \ onto the tyrosine residues of various</span> <span m='1366000'>substrate proteins.\
  \ And keep in mind as well the fact</span> <span m='1371000'>that we drew a series\
  \ of growth factor receptors which have tyrosine</span> <span m='1375000'>kinase\
  \ domains in them. And I'm drawing the tyrosine kinase</span> <span m='1380000'>domains\
  \ here like this, that when these growth factor</span> <span m='1386000'>receptors\
  \ become activated, they attach phosphate groups onto</span> <span m='1391000'>the\
  \ tails of one another. And I'll draw those phosphate</span> <span m='1397000'>groups\
  \ like this, i.e. the binding of ligand or let's</span> <span m='1402000'>say epidermal\
  \ growth factor ligand or plate ligand causes the two</span> <span m='1408000'>receptors,\
  \ which are normally mobilized in the plasma membrane to</span> <span m='1413000'>come\
  \ together to transphosphorylate one another,</span> <span m='1419000'>and having\
  \ done so, to acquire actively signaling powers,</span> <span m='1424000'>because\
  \ once these phosphates become attached, they now represent sites</span> <span m='1429000'>where\
  \ other molecules can anchor themselves and send out downstream</span> <span m='1434000'>signals.\
  \ In fact, there are altogether 90 different</span> <span m='1439000'>tyrosine kinases\
  \ encoded in the human genome.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>And so, to the extent\
  \ that these tyrosine kinases become</span> <span m='1449000'>hyperactivated in\
  \ various kinds of human cancers,</span> <span m='1453000'>this represents in principle\
  \ a very attractive way of developing an</span> <span m='1457000'>anti-cancer therapeutic.\
  \ But let's think about the problems</span> <span m='1461000'>that are inherent\
  \ in such a compound. First of all,</span> <span m='1465000'>if one wants to develop\
  \ an anti-cancer therapeutic,</span> <span m='1469000'>it must be reasonably specific\
  \ for the Abelson tyrosine kinase,</span> <span m='1474000'>and not the 89 kinds\
  \ of tyrosine kinases that also coexist in the</span> <span m='1478000'>human genome,\
  \ and are active, and apparently responsible for</span> <span m='1483000'>normal\
  \ cell metabolism in a whole variety of normal cell types.</span> </p><p><span m='1488000'>So,\
  \ one has to begin to think about the issue of cell activity.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1493000'>How can one possibly make a low molecular weight compound,</span>\
  \ <span m='1498000'>which is selectively able to inactivate the Abelson tyrosine</span>\
  \ <span m='1503000'>kinase as indicated here, the SH-1 group,</span> <span m='1508000'>but\
  \ doesn't disturb a whole variety of other tyrosine kinases that are</span> <span\
  \ m='1511000'>responsible for other normal physiological mechanisms.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1515000'>Well, you'll say that's pretty easy. We have 90 different genes.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1519000'>Each of the 90 different genes makes a distinct protein,</span>\
  \ <span m='1523000'>and these proteins should be very different. And therefore,</span>\
  \ <span m='1527000'>if one can, in fact, if one does the three-dimensional structure\
  \ of these</span> <span m='1531000'>proteins, all the tyrosine kinases look quite\
  \ similar.</span> </p><p><span m='1535000'>They have a biload structure. Here is\
  \ the active site of the</span> <span m='1540000'>enzyme. That is to say, in here\
  \ is the catalytic cleft,</span> <span m='1546000'>the site where the actual catalysis\
  \ takes place, the site where the</span> <span m='1551000'>gamma phosphate of ATP\
  \ is taken from the ATP and attached to a substrate</span> <span m='1557000'>protein\
  \ to the hydroxyl of a tyrosine of a protein that's about</span> <span m='1563000'>to\
  \ be phosphorylated. So, you just make a low moleculoid</span> <span m='1567000'>chemical\
  \ that's specific for the tyrosine kinase domain of the Abel</span> <span m='1571000'>protein.\
  \ And when I draw this biload structure,</span> <span m='1575000'>this biload structure\
  \ is carried here within the SH-1 domain right</span> <span m='1578000'>here. So,\
  \ this has a biload structure. It's obviously not</span> <span m='1582000'>indicated\
  \ here in this very schematic drawing.</span> </p><p><span m='1586000'>The problem\
  \ with that is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>All of the SH-1 domains,\
  \ all of the tyrosine kinase domains</span> <span m='1593000'>are evolutionarily\
  \ closely related to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>They're all derived\
  \ from the precursors of the tyrosine kinase</span> <span m='1601000'>domain that\
  \ probably existed maybe 600 or 700 million years ago,</span> <span m='1605000'>and\
  \ has as a consequence of gene duplication been diversified to make</span> <span\
  \ m='1609000'>90 different tyrosine kinases. And if you look under x-ray</span>\
  \ <span m='1613000'>crystallography at the three dimensional structure of all these</span>\
  \ <span m='1617000'>tyrosine kinases, they all pretty much look like this,</span>\
  \ <span m='1621000'>i.e. they all have rather similar catalytic clefts because they</span>\
  \ <span m='1624000'>diverge from a common ancestral protein, and they retain this\
  \ three</span> <span m='1628000'>dimensional configuration because this three dimensional\
  \ configuration</span> <span m='1632000'>seems to be important for the retention\
  \ of their function.</span> </p><p><span m='1635000'>You could imagine, conversely,\
  \ that if there were some descendants</span> <span m='1639000'>of the ancestral\
  \ tyrosine kinase domain that some of them became</span> <span m='1643000'>mutant\
  \ and lost its three dimensional structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1646000'>Those\
  \ descendant kinases would lose their ability to phosphorylate</span> <span m='1650000'>tyrosines\
  \ on substrate proteins, and therefore would be eliminated</span> <span m='1654000'>from\
  \ the gene pool because they would be defective.</span> </p><p><span m='1658000'>And\
  \ that explains the strong conservatism in the structure of</span> <span m='1662000'>these\
  \ 90 different enzymes. They all look very similar to one</span> <span m='1666000'>another,\
  \ and that creates a great difficulty for the drug developer</span> <span m='1670000'>because\
  \ a low molecular weight drug, which one would like to develop,</span> <span m='1674000'>that\
  \ fits in here. So, here I'll draw a low molecular</span> <span m='1678000'>weight\
  \ drug that interacts in a stereo-specific fashion with the</span> <span m='1682000'>amino\
  \ acid residues that are aligning this pocket,</span> <span m='1686000'>this catalytic\
  \ cleft, might bind and nicely inactivate the tyrosine</span> <span m='1690000'>kinase\
  \ domain of Abel. But at the same time,</span> <span m='1695000'>it might also bind\
  \ and inactivate a whole series of other tyrosine</span> <span m='1699000'>kinases,\
  \ and that in turn could lead to therapeutic disaster.</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>For\
  \ instance, if you had a non-selective agent,</span> <span m='1707000'>you could\
  \ treat a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient with a</span> <span m='1711000'>low\
  \ molecular weight inhibitor, a low molecular weight compound,</span> <span m='1715000'>which\
  \ would get into this pocket of the BCR Abel protein.</span> </p><p><span m='1719000'>But\
  \ it might similarly get into the catalytic cleft of the EGF receptor.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1723000'>And if it shot down the EGF receptor, it might cause a fatal</span>\
  \ <span m='1727000'>diarrhea because after all, the EGF receptor, I will tell you,</span>\
  \ <span m='1731000'>is needed to maintain the structure of the epithelial lining\
  \ of the</span> <span m='1736000'>colon. And so, you might kill the patient simply</span>\
  \ <span m='1740000'>because you had deprived the cells in that person's colon of\
  \ their</span> <span m='1744000'>ability to maintain themselves. There are a whole\
  \ series of growth</span> <span m='1748000'>factor receptors that are required for\
  \ hematapoeisis that we discussed</span> <span m='1752000'>last time. And there,\
  \ once again, if you had a</span> <span m='1756000'>nonselective compound, which\
  \ got into the domain of one of</span> <span m='1760000'>the growth factor receptors\
  \ that is responsible for hematapoeisis,</span> <span m='1763000'>you might shut\
  \ down the entire bone marrow, and once again kill the</span> <span m='1767000'>patient.\
  \ I'm just giving you those as overly dramatic examples of the</span> <span m='1771000'>fact\
  \ that cell activity is an extremely important consideration in</span> <span m='1775000'>developing\
  \ such a drug. The other thing is affinity for the</span> <span m='1780000'>target,\
  \ for the catalytic cleft that is being targeted.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>What\
  \ do I mean by affinity? If you look at those response</span> <span m='1796000'>curves\
  \ of various compounds, what you see is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1804000'>You\
  \ can draw out a line that looks like this, a graph that looks like</span> <span\
  \ m='1812000'>this, where here we have log of drug concentration.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1820000'>And here is 10-4, here, let's do the other one,</span> <span m='1828000'>10-8\
  \ molar, 10-7 molar, 10-6, 10-5, 10-4.</span> </p><p><span m='1836000'>And this\
  \ is molar drug concentration. And here is the percentage of</span> <span m='1842000'>inhibition.\
  \ Let's say, for example, we were able to take</span> <span m='1849000'>the BCR\
  \ Abel protein and study it in a test tube. And let's say we were</span> <span m='1855000'>interested\
  \ in studying how well its tyrosine kinase activity responded</span> <span m='1862000'>to\
  \ an applied drug that we developed against it.</span> </p><p><span m='1869000'>So,\
  \ here's the percentage of inhibition of tyrosine kinase</span> <span m='1876000'>activity\
  \ of BCR Abel protein. Now, I might be able to develop a</span> <span m='1884000'>drug\
  \ whose dose response curve would look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1892000'>And\
  \ you'll say, well, that's terrific.</span> </p><p><span m='1896000'>That's a drug\
  \ which shuts down BCR Abel. We haven't even dealt with</span> <span m='1900000'>the\
  \ issue of cell activity, but let's look at where one begins</span> <span m='1904000'>to\
  \ see a dose response right here, 10-5 molar. And if you calculate</span> <span\
  \ m='1908000'>back as to how much of the drug you need to deliver in order to shut</span>\
  \ <span m='1912000'>down the BCR Abel protein in a patient, the size of the pill\
  \ they'd</span> <span m='1916000'>have to get would probably be this big everyday.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1920000'>So, what you need to do is you need to be an acceptable\
  \ range of drug</span> <span m='1924000'>concentrations is down in this area here.\
  \ And therefore,</span> <span m='1928000'>only until you get a drug which has a\
  \ dose response curve that looks</span> <span m='1932000'>like this, which is two\
  \ or three orders of magnitude more potent</span> <span m='1936000'>where it's able\
  \ to shut down the kinase activity already at 10-7 in a,</span> <span m='1940000'>this\
  \ is called a submicromolar concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='1944000'>Micromolar\
  \ is 10-6. Here already at a tenth of a</span> <span m='1948000'>micromolar, 10-7\
  \ molar, we're already getting a shutdown of</span> <span m='1952000'>the enzyme\
  \ function. And if one can do that,</span> <span m='1956000'>then one might in principle\
  \ be able to develop a pill that's this big</span> <span m='1960000'>and give that\
  \ to the patient rather than a pill that's a size of a</span> <span m='1964000'>football.\
  \ And by the way, if you have to make lots of a very</span> <span m='1967000'>complex,\
  \ organic molecule through organic synthesis that has an</span> <span m='1971000'>affinity\
  \ of this, it's also very expensive.</span> </p><p><span m='1975000'>Obviously,\
  \ if you can make a compound that's a hundredfold more</span> <span m='1978000'>potent\
  \ and requires a hundredfold less material to deliver to the</span> <span m='1982000'>patient\
  \ body, then you might have some success in treating</span> <span m='1986000'>the\
  \ patient. Here's another issue.</span> </p><p><span m='1989000'>So, we've talked\
  \ about cell activity. We've talked about</span> <span m='1993000'>potency or affinity,\
  \ affinity for the substrate or</span> <span m='1997000'>potency. So, this would\
  \ be an acceptable drug.</span> </p><p><span m='2000000'>It works already at molar\
  \ concentration where the inflection</span> <span m='2004000'>point of this curve\
  \ is. This is an unacceptable drug at</span> <span m='2008000'>10-5. We can also\
  \ talk about</span> <span m='2012000'>pharmacokinetics. I want to give you a feeling\
  \ for</span> <span m='2016000'>how complex drug development is, and why it so rarely\
  \ succeeds. By</span> <span m='2020000'>the way, you know how much it costs to develop\
  \ a drug that's useful in</span> <span m='2024000'>the clinic these days and test\
  \ it on people? Anybody have any idea?</span> </p><p><span m='2029000'>How much?\
  \ Yeah. It's pretty close to $1 billion,</span> <span m='2033000'>between $900 million\
  \ and $1 billion. That's a lot of money. That's more</span> <span m='2037000'>money\
  \ than you and I are going to earn together, all of us</span> <span m='2041000'>maybe,\
  \ in a lifetime. OK, anyhow, pharmacokinetics,</span> <span m='2046000'>well what's\
  \ pharmacokinetics? Glad I asked that question.</span> </p><p><span m='2050000'>How\
  \ long does the drug stay inside of you after you take it if you're a</span> <span\
  \ m='2054000'>cancer patient? What happens if the drug is</span> <span m='2058000'>excreted\
  \ by the kidneys within minutes of its being taken,</span> <span m='2062000'>let's\
  \ say, either by injection or orally?</span> </p><p><span m='2066000'>So here we\
  \ can imagine, let's talk about drug concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>I'll\
  \ use the word drug concentration in blood.</span> </p><p><span m='2078000'>And\
  \ here's time. And here's what some drugs look like when you give</span> <span m='2084000'>them,\
  \ let's say, orally. Here's what they look like.</span> </p><p><span m='2090000'>So,\
  \ let's say here's the effective drug concentration: effective</span> <span m='2096000'>concentration.\
  \ And we know the effective</span> <span m='2102000'>concentration from doing measurements\
  \ like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2106000'>We just measure it, work that out.\
  \ So, let's say we develop a drug</span> <span m='2110000'>which is able to hit\
  \ the BCR Abel protein. What are the kinetics with</span> <span m='2114000'>which\
  \ the drug becomes soluble in the blood stream?</span> </p><p><span m='2118000'>And\
  \ it might look like this, where I'm drawing here now, this is</span> <span m='2122000'>one\
  \ hour. This is two hours. This is three hours, four hours.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2126000'>Is that long enough?</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>Well, the fact\
  \ of the matter is, if you're going to try to kill a</span> <span m='2134000'>cancer\
  \ cell, and that's what the name of this game is,</span> <span m='2138000'>you want\
  \ to have it around for a while because it turns out,</span> <span m='2141000'>as\
  \ one learned, the continued viability of the CML cancer cells of</span> <span m='2145000'>the\
  \ leukemia cells was dependent on the continued firing by the BCR Abel</span> <span\
  \ m='2149000'>kinase protein. In fact, as one learned,</span> <span m='2152000'>if\
  \ one shut off firing by the tyrosine kinase molecule in a</span> <span m='2156000'>chronic\
  \ myelogenous leukemia cell, the cells would implode.</span> </p><p><span m='2160000'>They\
  \ would undergo apitosis. So, this began to reveal that in</span> <span m='2164000'>fact\
  \ the BCR Abel protein is not only responsible for forcing these</span> <span m='2168000'>cells\
  \ to proliferate, but it also independently provides</span> <span m='2172000'>them\
  \ with anti-apoptotic signal. It keeps them from falling over the</span> <span m='2176000'>cliff\
  \ into apitosis. It keeps them from killing</span> <span m='2180000'>themselves,\
  \ and that's obviously critical for the ability of this</span> <span m='2184000'>tumor\
  \ to proliferate, for the number of cells to expand in</span> <span m='2188000'>the\
  \ body of a patient. It turns out that if you provide</span> <span m='2192000'>these\
  \ cancer cells with an effective way of shutting down their BCR Abel</span> <span\
  \ m='2197000'>protein for 30 or 40 or 50 minutes, not much happens to them. You\
  \ need</span> <span m='2202000'>to deprive them of the drug for a very long period\
  \ of time,</span> <span m='2207000'>well, 15-20 hours, and therefore you need pharmacokinetics\
  \ that look like</span> <span m='2212000'>this. It needs to be present for an extended\
  \ period of time,</span> <span m='2217000'>or even better, let me re-draw that,\
  \ even better look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2223000'>It stays in the blood\
  \ for an extended period of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2226000'>Some drugs stay\
  \ in the circulation for a long time.</span> </p><p><span m='2230000'>Other drugs\
  \ stay in the circulation for a very short period of time.</span> </p><p><span m='2233000'>There's\
  \ another problem which we haven't even begun to talk about,</span> <span m='2237000'>and\
  \ that is the metabolism of the drug. It turns out that many drugs</span> <span\
  \ m='2241000'>that you give a patient are rapidly converted by the enzymes and the</span>\
  \ <span m='2244000'>liver which are normally responsible for detoxifying chemicals\
  \ that come</span> <span m='2248000'>into our body. And therefore,</span> <span\
  \ m='2252000'>many of the drugs that come into our bodies are with greater or lesser</span>\
  \ <span m='2256000'>speed altered into something else, detoxified, and therefore\
  \ rendered</span> <span m='2260000'>innocuous. Now you'll say, well, you can figure\
  \ that out too,</span> <span m='2264000'>but here's an additional fly in the ointment.\
  \ Because we are a</span> <span m='2268000'>polymorphic population, because we humans\
  \ are genetically</span> <span m='2272000'>heterogeneous, one from the other,</span>\
  \ <span m='2276000'>some of us metabolize a given drug much more rapidly than others\
  \ do.</span> </p><p><span m='2280000'>And here, we have a situation where potentially,\
  \ most of us might</span> <span m='2284000'>metabolize a drug very quickly, in which\
  \ case the physicians would</span> <span m='2288000'>want to give us a very high\
  \ dose of the drug so that we have enough of</span> <span m='2293000'>the drug around\
  \ for a long enough period of time to do some effect.</span> </p><p><span m='2297000'>So\
  \ let's say that 97% of us are able to metabolize the drug very</span> <span m='2302000'>quickly,\
  \ and as a consequence, we're given a very high dosage in</span> <span m='2306000'>order\
  \ to have some effective dosage reaching the tumor to compensate for</span> <span\
  \ m='2311000'>the fact that much of this drug is rapidly eliminated by metabolism</span>\
  \ <span m='2315000'>in the liver. It's inter-converted into another</span> <span\
  \ m='2320000'>chemically innocuous compound. Well, you'll say, that's good.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2324000'>We'll just take a large dose of that compound,</span>\
  \ <span m='2328000'>but let's think about the other 3% in the population who metabolize</span>\
  \ <span m='2332000'>this compound very slowly. Like the other 97%, these</span>\
  \ <span m='2336000'>individuals will be given a high dose of the drug because experience</span>\
  \ <span m='2340000'>shows that in general, most human beings metabolize a drug</span>\
  \ <span m='2344000'>very quickly. These individuals metabolize the</span> <span\
  \ m='2349000'>drug very slowly, and what's going to happen to them?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2353000'>Well, they might croak. Why? Because that drug is going to be</span>\
  \ <span m='2358000'>around in potent biologically active form for an extended period\
  \ of time</span> <span m='2363000'>in their bodies, and might have in them a lethal</span>\
  \ <span m='2367000'>outcome. So therefore, we have to deal with the effects of</span>\
  \ <span m='2372000'>variability in drug metabolism, variability in metabolism because\
  \ it</span> <span m='2377000'>turns out that different people metabolize the drug\
  \ differently and</span> <span m='2383000'>that variability in drug metabolism is\
  \ vastly greater if you compare the</span> <span m='2389000'>way we metabolize drugs\
  \ to the way that laboratory mice metabolize</span> <span m='2394000'>drugs. Well,\
  \ you'll say, why should we care about how</span> <span m='2400000'>laboratory mice\
  \ metabolize this or that drug?</span> </p><p><span m='2406000'>Why is it important?\
  \ The fact is, the first tryouts of a</span> <span m='2410000'>candidate drug are\
  \ tried out in laboratory mice where laboratory</span> <span m='2415000'>mice are\
  \ given a tumor, and they're injected with the drug</span> <span m='2420000'>to\
  \ see whether the tumor begins to shrink. But if it's the case,</span> <span m='2425000'>if\
  \ the laboratory mice metabolize a drug in a vastly different way than</span> <span\
  \ m='2429000'>do humans, then the outcome of working with laboratory mice might</span>\
  \ <span m='2434000'>be enormously misleading. And these are just some of the</span>\
  \ <span m='2439000'>problems that bedevil the development of a drug.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2444000'>In any case, around 1994, at a company which was a precursor</span>\
  \ <span m='2450000'>of Novartis, it was called Ciba-Geigy in Basel,</span> <span\
  \ m='2455000'>Switzerland. They developed a highly specific and potent anti-Abel,</span>\
  \ <span m='2460000'>low molecular weight compound, which came to be called Leveck.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2466000'>Or in Europe it's called Gleveck. It's also pronounced\
  \ Leveck, but</span> <span m='2470000'>it's spelled differently. In fact, it was\
  \ one of the other</span> <span m='2475000'>difficulties of developing this drug\
  \ was the following.</span> </p><p><span m='2479000'>The higher ups in the drug\
  \ company who were paying for this research</span> <span m='2484000'>wanted on repeated\
  \ occasion to scrub this entire drug development</span> <span m='2488000'>program.\
  \ Why? Because the number of cases of</span> <span m='2493000'>chronic myelogenous\
  \ leukemia overall worldwide is relatively small.</span> </p><p><span m='2497000'>How\
  \ many are in this country every year? I don't know,</span> <span m='2502000'>10\
  \ or 15,000. So, the question was, economically speaking, would the</span> <span\
  \ m='2507000'>relatively small number of cases of this disease justify their investing</span>\
  \ <span m='2511000'>$1 billion in the development of the drug. Maybe it would take\
  \ them a</span> <span m='2516000'>generation to get any payback from their initial\
  \ investment.</span> </p><p><span m='2521000'>And so, they tried time after time,\
  \ time and again, to shut down this</span> <span m='2525000'>development program\
  \ because it didn't seem to have any clear,</span> <span m='2529000'>long-term economic\
  \ benefit. Of course, now we're not talking about</span> <span m='2534000'>biology.\
  \ We're talking about economics, and rational economics.</span> </p><p><span m='2538000'>This\
  \ is not avarice on their part. A drug company like that cannot go</span> <span\
  \ m='2543000'>on spending $1 billion here and $1 billion there without at one point</span>\
  \ <span m='2547000'>or another leading to a major financial hemorrhage.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2552000'>So, Gleveck turned out to be highly specific for the Abel kinase,</span>\
  \ <span m='2558000'>and as it turned out, for two other kinds of kinases as well.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2564000'>Another kind of kinase is against a tyrosine kinase receptor\
  \ called KIT,</span> <span m='2570000'>this is a receptor tyrosine kinase, and another\
  \ receptor tyrosine kinase</span> <span m='2576000'>called the PDGF receptor, which\
  \ we've also encountered in</span> <span m='2582000'>passing earlier. These two\
  \ other growth factor</span> <span m='2587000'>receptors, KIT and the PDGF receptor\
  \ also have tyrosine kinase domains.</span> </p><p><span m='2592000'>They therefore\
  \ follow this overall structural plan here,</span> <span m='2596000'>and it turns\
  \ out by evolutionary quirk that the structures of their</span> <span m='2601000'>tyrosine\
  \ kinase domains are actually similar in certain ways to the</span> <span m='2606000'>tyrosine\
  \ kinase domain of Abel, and therefore of BCR Abel.</span> </p><p><span m='2611000'>So,\
  \ in fact, they didn't actually have a totally specific drug which</span> <span\
  \ m='2615000'>would attack only one out of the 90-tyrosine kinases encoded in their</span>\
  \ <span m='2619000'>genome. It attacked three of the 90-tyrosine kinases,</span>\
  \ <span m='2624000'>the Abel, the KITT, and the PDGF receptor. And this might,</span>\
  \ <span m='2628000'>on its own, have already proven to be the death nail for the\
  \ protein,</span> <span m='2633000'>except they began to try it out for patients,\
  \ and they saw some</span> <span m='2637000'>remarkable responses. It turned out\
  \ that the great</span> <span m='2642000'>majority of CML patients who were treated\
  \ with Gleveck at therapeutic</span> <span m='2648000'>concentrations ended up having\
  \ a rapid remission of their chronic</span> <span m='2653000'>myelogenous leukemia\
  \ disease, which ultimately resulted in their</span> <span m='2658000'>being outwardly\
  \ free of the disease. This is your question of the day.</span> </p><p><span m='2685000'>So,\
  \ Gleveck goes into the catalytic cleft of the Abel tyrosine kinase.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2689000'>It blocks the ATP binding site because keep in mind that these</span>\
  \ <span m='2694000'>enzymes need to grab the gamma phosphate off of ATP and transfer\
  \ it</span> <span m='2699000'>to a protein substrate, and it does so because it\
  \ hydrogen</span> <span m='2704000'>bonds to the amino acids which are lining this\
  \ catalytic cleft.</span> </p><p><span m='2709000'>In other words, this catalytic\
  \ cleft up here is</span> <span m='2712000'>obviously made of amino acids, and there\
  \ are hydrogen bonds which</span> <span m='2716000'>Gleveck can form with the amino\
  \ acid resides that you're lining on both</span> <span m='2720000'>sides of the\
  \ cleft. I should have brought you a picture</span> <span m='2723000'>of that. And,\
  \ a similar kind of hydrogen bonding</span> <span m='2727000'>can occur with the\
  \ amino acids that are aligning the catalytic clefts of</span> <span m='2731000'>the\
  \ PDGF receptor and KIT, and that hydrogen bonding can occur</span> <span m='2735000'>already\
  \ at concentrations that are submicromolar,</span> <span m='2739000'>less than 10-6\
  \ molar, 10-7, even sometimes 10-8 molar</span> <span m='2743000'>under certain\
  \ conditions. So, it's a high affinity binding,</span> <span m='2748000'>and it's\
  \ relatively specific. Only three out of the 90 different</span> <span m='2752000'>kinases\
  \ are bound. We can do the following kind of</span> <span m='2756000'>experiment.\
  \ If I were to add Gleveck to cells</span> <span m='2762000'>with BCR Abel function,\
  \ this is the response that BCR Abel</span> <span m='2770000'>would show. Here is\
  \ the response that the EGF receptor would show.</span> </p><p><span m='2777000'>So,\
  \ if I dose the patient at this concentration of drug,</span> <span m='2785000'>Gleveck\
  \ will shut down the BCR Abel protein.</span> </p><p><span m='2793000'>But it won't\
  \ shut down the EGF receptor, which requires vastly</span> <span m='2797000'>higher\
  \ concentrations of drug in order to shut down its tyrosine</span> <span m='2801000'>kinase\
  \ domain. And right here,</span> <span m='2805000'>we can see what we call selectivity.\
  \ The fact that this enzyme responds</span> <span m='2809000'>at very log drug concentration,\
  \ this enzyme EGF receptor and its</span> <span m='2813000'>tyrosine kinase, it's\
  \ a growth factor receptor once</span> <span m='2817000'>again, requires a vastly\
  \ higher concentration drug in order to</span> <span m='2821000'>elicit an outcome.\
  \ So, what happened to the chronic</span> <span m='2824000'>myelogenous leukemia\
  \ patients. The great majority of them between</span> <span m='2828000'>70-80% had\
  \ a miraculous collapse of their disease.</span> </p><p><span m='2832000'>In most\
  \ cases, this disease could be monitored</span> <span m='2836000'>microscopically.\
  \ One could look for the immature</span> <span m='2840000'>myeloid cells in their\
  \ blood and see where they were previously present</span> <span m='2844000'>in vast\
  \ numbers. They were microscopically now</span> <span m='2848000'>indetectable (sic).\
  \ However, in those patients where the</span> <span m='2852000'>disease seemed to\
  \ collapse, one could still use the PCR test to</span> <span m='2858000'>demonstrate\
  \ there were residual cancer cells in their blood.</span> </p><p><span m='2864000'>How\
  \ could one do that? Well, let's imagine that here is the PCR</span> <span m='2869000'>Abel\
  \ fusion protein. So, here's PCR, and here's Abel</span> <span m='2875000'>over\
  \ here. You can make PCR primers,</span> <span m='2880000'>one of which is specific\
  \ for a PCR sequence, and the other of which is</span> <span m='2885000'>specific\
  \ for an Abel sequence, and the only time that you'll get a</span> <span m='2889000'>PCR\
  \ product is if these two sequences exist on the same</span> <span m='2894000'>messenger\
  \ RNA molecule that's reverse transcribed into a CDNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2899000'>You\
  \ could even do this genomic DNA as well, and so one can specifically</span> <span\
  \ m='2903000'>detect using this PCR test the presence of cells which have this</span>\
  \ <span m='2908000'>chromosomal translocation. If one of the PCR primers is against</span>\
  \ <span m='2913000'>BCR and the other is Abel, and the distances between these two</span>\
  \ <span m='2917000'>primers is not too far away, not more than, let's say, kilobase,</span>\
  \ <span m='2922000'>so you get rather efficient PCR amplification.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2926000'>So, it turned out that the great majority of patients who were</span>\
  \ <span m='2931000'>cytologically cured, cytology means a cytological</span> <span\
  \ m='2935000'>analysis represents what you see through in microscopes.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2940000'>So these patients, if you looked at a smear of their</span> <span\
  \ m='2944000'>blood, cytologically they were cured. But if you used PCR analysis,</span>\
  \ <span m='2948000'>which is far more sensitive, one could detect residual cancer\
  \ cells</span> <span m='2952000'>that might be present in one out of 105 or one\
  \ out of 106 cells moving</span> <span m='2957000'>around in circulation, which\
  \ are almost invisible if you're</span> <span m='2961000'>looking through a very\
  \ complex mixture of cells through the light</span> <span m='2965000'>microscope.\
  \ And so, what happened was that patients</span> <span m='2969000'>began to relapse,\
  \ and after a period of several years,</span> <span m='2974000'>a number of patients\
  \ began to show a restoration of their CML condition.</span> </p><p><span m='2978000'>In\
  \ fact, in one recent European study, indicates that between 10-12%</span> <span\
  \ m='2983000'>of the CML patients who were treated with Gleveck relapsed every year.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2988000'>What do I mean by relapse? I mean they show a resurgence\
  \ of their</span> <span m='2992000'>disease. The disease comes back to life, and\
  \ they once again</span> <span m='2997000'>have the disease. And interestingly enough,</span>\
  \ <span m='3002000'>if one now looks at their cancer cells, what do you see?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='3008000'>In virtually every case you see some alteration in the\
  \ BCR Abel</span> <span m='3014000'>protein. In the great majority of instances,\
  \ you see point mutations</span> <span m='3019000'>that affect amino acid residues\
  \ lining the cavity here,</span> <span m='3025000'>lining the cavity of the Abel\
  \ kinase protein.</span> </p><p><span m='3031000'>Those amino acid substitutions\
  \ do not compromise the tyrosine kinase</span> <span m='3035000'>activity of this\
  \ enzyme. But they do prevent Gleveck from</span> <span m='3040000'>binding, and\
  \ as a consequence, now you begin to have patients whose</span> <span m='3044000'>tumors\
  \ are no longer responsive to Gleveck. And what's happened now is</span> <span m='3049000'>one\
  \ has developed a new generation of compounds which binds into this</span> <span\
  \ m='3053000'>pocket even in the presence of these amino acid substitutions to retreat</span>\
  \ <span m='3058000'>these patients. See you on Wednesday.</span> </p>"
