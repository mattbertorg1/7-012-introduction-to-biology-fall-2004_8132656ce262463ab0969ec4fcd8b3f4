transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>Good morning, class.</span> </p><p><span m='4000'>I\
  \ just wanted to spend the first couple minutes clearing up three</span> <span m='8000'>issues.\
  \ None is a major conceptual issue, but we like to focus on</span> <span m='12000'>details\
  \ and get them right, get them correct here as well.</span> </p><p><span m='17000'>Firstly,\
  \ I misdrew a reaction last time that described why RNA is</span> <span m='21000'>alkali\
  \ labile, i.e., if we have high pH we call</span> <span m='26000'>that an alkali\
  \ pH, or an alkaline pH, actually,</span> <span m='30000'>to use the adjective.\
  \ And we said that hydroxyl groups can</span> <span m='35000'>cause the cleavage\
  \ of the phosphodiester bonds of RNA but not</span> <span m='39000'>DNA. And the\
  \ way I described that happening is that the alkali group</span> <span m='44000'>causes\
  \ the formation of this five-membered ring right here,</span> <span m='49000'>two\
  \ carbons, two oxygens and a phosphate. And that resolves</span> <span m='53000'>eventually\
  \ to this where there's no longer any connection with the</span> <span m='58000'>ribonucleoside\
  \ monophosphate below. And I drew it like this,</span> <span m='63000'>without an\
  \ oxygen, and that's a no-no because,</span> <span m='67000'>in fact, in truth,\
  \ and as many of you picked up,</span> <span m='72000'>this reverts to a two prime\
  \ hydroxyl. So, please note there's a mistake</span> <span m='76000'>there. There's\
  \ also a couple other mistakes. For example,</span> <span m='81000'>in the textbook\
  \ it gives you the impression that when you polymerize</span> <span m='85000'>nucleic\
  \ acids you use a monophosphate to do so.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>And, if\
  \ you listened to my lecture last time, that doesn't make any</span> <span m='94000'>sense,\
  \ because you need to invest the energy of a triphosphate in</span> <span m='98000'>order\
  \ to create enough energy to generate enough energy for the</span> <span m='102000'>polymerization.\
  \ The textbook is incorrect there.</span> </p><p><span m='106000'>Textbooks are\
  \ written by people, for better or worse,</span> <span m='111000'>and as such, like\
  \ everything else, they are a mortal and fallible. So,</span> <span m='115000'>the\
  \ truth of the matter is, when you're polymerizing DNA or RNA you</span> <span m='119000'>need\
  \ one of the four ribonucleoside or deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates</span> <span\
  \ m='123000'>in order to donate the energy that makes possible this polymerization.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='128000'>And please note that is a mistake in the book. Recall,</span>\
  \ <span m='132000'>as I said last time, the fact that ATP is really the</span> <span\
  \ m='136000'>currency of energy in the cell, and that its energy is stored and</span>\
  \ <span m='140000'>coiled up in this pent up spring where the mutual electrostatic</span>\
  \ <span m='144000'>repulsion between the three negatively charged phosphates</span>\
  \ <span m='148000'>carries with it enormous potential energy.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='153000'>And some of that potential energy can be realized,</span> <span m='156000'>during\
  \ the synthesis of polymerization of nucleic acids by</span> <span m='160000'>cleaving\
  \ this bond here. One can also generate potential</span> <span m='163000'>energy\
  \ by cleaving this bond here. This is the alpha, the beta and the</span> <span m='167000'>gamma-phosphate.\
  \ And cleavage of either can create</span> <span m='171000'>substantial energy,\
  \ which in turn can, as we'll indicate</span> <span m='174000'>shortly, be invested\
  \ in other reactions. The reaction</span> <span m='178000'>of polymerization. A\
  \ second point I'd like to make to</span> <span m='181000'>you is the following,\
  \ and you'd say it's kind of</span> <span m='185000'>coincidence. The currency of\
  \ energy in the cell is ATP,</span> <span m='189000'>adenosine triphosphate, we\
  \ see its structure here,</span> <span m='193000'>and this happens to be one of\
  \ the four precursors of the RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='197000'>So, the same molecule\
  \ is used in these two different ostensively</span> <span m='201000'>unrelated applications.\
  \ One, to polymerize to make RNA</span> <span m='205000'>where genetic information\
  \ is stored and conveyed.</span> </p><p><span m='209000'>Or, alternatively it's\
  \ used here in this context in order to serve as a</span> <span m='213000'>currency\
  \ for energy. High energy as ATP. ADP with a</span> <span m='217000'>little lower\
  \ energy. AMP monophosphate with even lower</span> <span m='221000'>energy. And\
  \ you might ask yourself, scratch your head and say why is the</span> <span m='226000'>same\
  \ molecule used for these two different things?</span> </p><p><span m='230000'>In\
  \ fact, there are yet other applications of these</span> <span m='234000'>ribonucleosides\
  \ which also seem to be unrelated to the storage or the</span> <span m='238000'>conveyance\
  \ of genetic information. And it is believed,</span> <span m='242000'>probably correctly,\
  \ that the reason why the same molecule is used for</span> <span m='246000'>these\
  \ totally different applications is that early in the evolution of</span> <span\
  \ m='250000'>life on this planet there really were a rather small number of</span>\
  \ <span m='254000'>biological molecules that existed. Indeed, as we'll mention again</span>\
  \ <span m='258000'>later, it's probably the case that the first organisms didn't\
  \ use DNA</span> <span m='262000'>as genomes. It's an article of faith with us that\
  \ one stores</span> <span m='266000'>genetic information in DNA molecules.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='270000'>And I implied that quite explicitly last time. But,</span>\
  \ <span m='273000'>the fact of the matter is, it's probably the case that the</span>\
  \ <span m='277000'>first organism, the first pre-cellular life forms</span> <span\
  \ m='281000'>used RNA as the genetic material, RNA to store things, replicating\
  \ RNA</span> <span m='284000'>via double-stranded RNA molecules as a way of archiving\
  \ genetic</span> <span m='288000'>information. And only later during the evolution\
  \ of life on this planet,</span> <span m='292000'>when that later was we can't tell,\
  \ but it could have been a hundred or</span> <span m='296000'>two hundred years\
  \ later. Obviously, if we're talking about</span> <span m='300000'>the origin of\
  \ life as between 3. and 3.5 billion years ago, we can't</span> <span m='304000'>really\
  \ localize that in time very well, but only later was DNA</span> <span m='309000'>assigned\
  \ the job of storing, in a stable fashion, genetic</span> <span m='313000'>information.\
  \ And as a consequence, we come to realize as well yet</span> <span m='318000'>another\
  \ discovery, which is that all the catalysts that</span> <span m='323000'>we're\
  \ going to talk about today, the enzymes as we call them, almost</span> <span m='327000'>all\
  \ modern-day enzymes are proteins. And we talked about them briefly</span> <span\
  \ m='332000'>before. But over the last 15 years, 20 years there's been the discovery</span>\
  \ <span m='336000'>that certain RNA molecules also posses the ability to catalyze</span>\
  \ <span m='340000'>certain kinds of reactions. When I was taking biochemistry,</span>\
  \ <span m='345000'>if somebody would have told me that, I would have called the\
  \ psychiatric</span> <span m='349000'>ward because that was such an outlandish idea.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='353000'>How can an RNA molecule catalyze a biochemical reaction?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='358000'>It doesn't have all the side groups that one needs to\
  \ create the</span> <span m='362000'>catalytic sites for reactions. But we now realize,\
  \ on the basis of</span> <span m='366000'>research which actually led to a Nobel\
  \ Prize being awarded about five</span> <span m='370000'>years ago, that RNA molecules\
  \ are able to catalyze certain kinds of</span> <span m='374000'>reactions. And that\
  \ begins to give us an insight into how life</span> <span m='378000'>originated\
  \ on this planet because RNA molecules may have stored</span> <span m='382000'>genetic\
  \ information, as I said before, RNA molecules,</span> <span m='386000'>or their\
  \ precursors like ATP, may have been their currency for storing</span> <span m='390000'>high\
  \ energy bonds, as is indicated here.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>And RNA molecules\
  \ may well have been the first enzymes to catalyze many</span> <span m='398000'>of\
  \ the reactions in the most primitive life forms that first</span> <span m='403000'>existed\
  \ on this planet. And, therefore, what I'm saying is</span> <span m='407000'>that\
  \ as life developed in the first hundred or two hundred million years,</span> <span\
  \ m='412000'>who knows how long it took, gradually DNA took over the job of</span>\
  \ <span m='416000'>storing information from RNA and gradually proteins took over\
  \ the job</span> <span m='421000'>of mediating catalysis, of acting as enzymes to\
  \ taking over</span> <span m='425000'>the job from RNA molecules. Today there are\
  \ certain vestigial</span> <span m='430000'>biochemical reactions which we believe\
  \ are relics,</span> <span m='434000'>echoes of the beginning of life on earth,\
  \ which are still mediated by</span> <span m='438000'>RNA catalysts. We think that\
  \ they are throwbacks</span> <span m='442000'>to these very early steps, maybe even\
  \ in pre-cellular life form</span> <span m='446000'>where RNA was delegated with\
  \ the task of acting as a catalyst.</span> </p><p><span m='451000'>We're going to\
  \ focus a lot today on the whole issue of biochemical</span> <span m='455000'>reactions\
  \ and the issue of energy. And this gets us into the</span> <span m='460000'>realization\
  \ that there really are two kinds of biochemical reactions.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='465000'>Some of you may have learned this a long time ago.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='469000'>Either exergonic reactions that release energy,</span> <span m='474000'>that\
  \ produce energy as they proceed, or conversely endergonic reactions</span> <span\
  \ m='479000'>which require an investment of energy in order to move forward.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='484000'>So, here, obviously, if this is a high energy state and</span>\
  \ <span m='488000'>we're talking about the free energy of the system,</span> <span\
  \ m='492000'>which is one way to depict in thermodynamic language how much</span>\
  \ <span m='496000'>energy is in a molecule, if we go from a high energy state to</span>\
  \ <span m='500000'>a low energy state then we can draw this like this and we can\
  \ realize</span> <span m='504000'>that in order to conserve energy, the energy that\
  \ was inherent in this</span> <span m='508000'>molecule, the high potential energy\
  \ is released as this ball or this</span> <span m='512000'>molecule rolls down the\
  \ hill. And, therefore,</span> <span m='517000'>the reaction yields energy, it's\
  \ exergonic. And, conversely,</span> <span m='521000'>if we want this reaction to\
  \ proceed, we need to invest free energy in</span> <span m='525000'>order to make\
  \ it happen. The free energy happens to be,</span> <span m='529000'>more often than\
  \ not, in the form of chemical bonds,</span> <span m='533000'>i.e., energy that\
  \ can be invested, for example, by taking advantage of</span> <span m='537000'>the\
  \ potential energy stored in these phosphodiester,</span> <span m='541000'>in these\
  \ phosphate-phosphate linkages indicated right here.</span> </p><p><span m='546000'>Here,\
  \ by the way, is the space-filling model of ATP</span> <span m='550000'>just for\
  \ your information. That's the way it actually would</span> <span m='554000'>look\
  \ in life, and this is the way we actually draw it.</span> </p><p><span m='558000'>Now,\
  \ having said that, if we look at the free energy</span> <span m='562000'>profile\
  \ of various biochemical changes then we can depict them,</span> <span m='566000'>once\
  \ again, in this very schematic way here.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>And, by\
  \ the way, free energy is called G,</span> <span m='575000'>the Gibbs free energy\
  \ after Josiah Gibbs who was a thermodynamic wiz in</span> <span m='580000'>the\
  \ 19th century at Yale in New Haven. And here what we see is that</span> <span m='585000'>the\
  \ change in free energy between the reactants and the products is</span> <span m='590000'>given\
  \ by delta G. So, by definition,</span> <span m='595000'>we start out the reaction\
  \ with reactants.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>And we end up at the end of the\
  \ reaction with products.</span> </p><p><span m='603000'>And, overall, if the reaction\
  \ is exergonic and will proceed forward,</span> <span m='607000'>it releases energy.\
  \ And the net release of energy is indicated here</span> <span m='611000'>by delta\
  \ G. But, more often than not,</span> <span m='615000'>biochemical reactions that\
  \ are energetically favored,</span> <span m='618000'>that are exergonic actually\
  \ can't happen spontaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='622000'>They don't happen spontaneously\
  \ because, for various reasons,</span> <span m='626000'>they have to pass through\
  \ an intermediate state.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>Which actually represents\
  \ a much higher free energy than the initial</span> <span m='634000'>reactants posses.\
  \ And this higher free energy,</span> <span m='638000'>that they need to acquire\
  \ in order to move over the hill and down into</span> <span m='642000'>the valley,\
  \ is called the energy of activation, the activation energy.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='646000'>And, therefore, if I were to supply these reactants with energy,</span>\
  \ <span m='650000'>for instance, let's say I were to heat up these reactants and</span>\
  \ <span m='654000'>therefore give them a higher degree of thermal energy which they\
  \ might</span> <span m='658000'>be able to use to move up to this high energy state.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='663000'>I supplied them with free energy by giving them heat.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='666000'>Then they might be able to move up to here and then roll\
  \ down the hill.</span> </p><p><span m='669000'>But in the absence of actually actively\
  \ intervening and supplying</span> <span m='672000'>them that energy, they'll remain\
  \ right here,</span> <span m='676000'>and they may remain right there for a million\
  \ years,</span> <span m='679000'>even though in principle, if they were to reach\
  \ down here,</span> <span m='682000'>they would be much happier in terms of reaching\
  \ a much lower</span> <span m='686000'>energy state. To state the obvious,</span>\
  \ <span m='690000'>all these kinds of reactions wish to reach the lowest energy\
  \ state</span> <span m='694000'>possible. But in real-time it can't happen if there\
  \ is a high energy of</span> <span m='698000'>activation. Now, what do enzymes do?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='702000'>As always, I'm glad I asked that question. What they do\
  \ is they</span> <span m='707000'>lower the energy of activation. And this is in\
  \ one sense obvious,</span> <span m='711000'>and in one sense it's subtle, because\
  \ enzymes have no affect on</span> <span m='715000'>the free energy state of the\
  \ reactants, they have no affect on</span> <span m='719000'>the free energy of the\
  \ products. All they do is to lower the hump,</span> <span m='723000'>and they may\
  \ lower it very substantially.</span> </p><p><span m='727000'>And because they lower\
  \ it substantially,</span> <span m='731000'>it might be that some of the reactants\
  \ here may,</span> <span m='735000'>just through a chance, acquisition of thermal\
  \ energy,</span> <span m='738000'>be able to move over the much lowered hump and\
  \ move down into this</span> <span m='742000'>state right here. Now, the actual\
  \ difference in the</span> <span m='746000'>Gibbs free energy is totally unaffected.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='750000'>All that happens is that the enzyme, by lowering the energy\
  \ of activation,</span> <span m='755000'>make this possible in real-time. The fact\
  \ is that ultimately, if one</span> <span m='760000'>were to plot many kinds of\
  \ reactions, many reactions,</span> <span m='766000'>as is indicated here, have\
  \ a very high activation energy,</span> <span m='771000'>and therefore we look at\
  \ it like this. But there could be other</span> <span m='776000'>reactions which\
  \ might have an activation energy that looks like</span> <span m='782000'>this,\
  \ almost nothing at all. And these reactions could happen</span> <span m='787000'>spontaneously\
  \ at room temperature in the absence of any intervention by</span> <span m='791000'>an\
  \ enzyme. For example, let's say we're talking about a</span> <span m='795000'>carboxyl\
  \ group which discharges a proton. We've talked about that</span> <span m='799000'>already.\
  \ Well, that reaction happens spontaneously</span> <span m='803000'>at room temperature.\
  \ It doesn\x91t need an enzyme to make</span> <span m='807000'>it happen. It can\
  \ happen because there's essentially not</span> <span m='811000'>energy of activation.\
  \ But the great majority of</span> <span m='815000'>biochemical reactions do have\
  \ such an activation energy,</span> <span m='819000'>and therefore do require a\
  \ lowering like this in order to take place.</span> </p><p><span m='824000'>Now,\
  \ let's imagine other versions of the energy profile of a reaction.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='829000'>And keep in mind that what I'm showing here on the abscissa is just</span>\
  \ <span m='833000'>the course of the reaction. You could imagine I'm not really</span>\
  \ <span m='838000'>plotting time. I'm just talking about a situation</span> <span\
  \ m='845000'>where to the left the reaction hasn't happened and to the right it</span>\
  \ <span m='853000'>has happened. Can you see this over there? Then I won't write\
  \ over</span> <span m='861000'>there. All right. Let's see if this works.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='870000'>Boy, here we are in the 21st century and we still haven't\
  \ worked this out.</span> </p><p><span m='876000'>OK. Everybody can see this right\
  \ here, right? OK.</span> </p><p><span m='882000'>So, look. Let's imagine we have\
  \ a reaction that looks like this,</span> <span m='888000'>a reaction profile that\
  \ looks like this, where these two energies are</span> <span m='894000'>actually\
  \ equivalent. OK? I've tried to draw them on.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>Well,\
  \ they're not exactly, but they're pretty much on exactly</span> <span m='904000'>the\
  \ same level. And let's say we start out with a</span> <span m='908000'>large number\
  \ of molecules right over here. Now, if there were an enzyme</span> <span m='913000'>around,\
  \ the enzyme might lower the activation energy and,</span> <span m='917000'>in so\
  \ doing, make it possible for molecules to tunnel through this</span> <span m='921000'>hill\
  \ and move over here. The fact that when a molecule gets</span> <span m='926000'>over\
  \ here it has the same free energy as over there means that the</span> <span m='930000'>catalyst\
  \ may, in principle, also facilitate a back reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='935000'>What\
  \ do I mean by a back reaction? I mean going in exactly the</span> <span m='938000'>opposite\
  \ direction. And so, once molecules over here</span> <span m='942000'>are formed,\
  \ the energy lowering affects of the enzyme may allow them</span> <span m='946000'>to\
  \ move in both directions. And, therefore, what we will have</span> <span m='950000'>is\
  \ ultimately the establishment of an equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='954000'>If\
  \ these two energy states are equivalent then,</span> <span m='958000'>I will tell\
  \ you, 50% of the molecules end up here and 50% of the</span> <span m='962000'>molecules\
  \ end up here. And here we're beginning now to</span> <span m='966000'>wrestle between\
  \ two different independent concepts,</span> <span m='970000'>the rate of the reaction\
  \ and the equilibrium state of the reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>Note\
  \ that the enzyme has no affect whatsoever on the equilibrium state.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='979000'>These two are at equal free energies, the equilibrium state.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='983000'>Whether the energy barrier is this high or whether it's\
  \ this</span> <span m='987000'>high is irrelevant. The fact is if the enzyme makes</span>\
  \ <span m='992000'>possible this motion back and forth, the ultimate equilibrium\
  \ state will</span> <span m='996000'>be 50% of the molecules here and 50% of the\
  \ molecules there.</span> </p><p><span m='1000000'>And, therefore, the enzyme really\
  \ only affects the rate at which the</span> <span m='1004000'>reaction takes place.\
  \ Will it happen in a microsecond or</span> <span m='1008000'>will it happen in\
  \ a day or will it happen in a million years?</span> </p><p><span m='1012000'>The\
  \ enzyme has no affect whatsoever on the ultimate end product,</span> <span m='1016000'>which\
  \ in this case is the equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='1020000'>Of course, there\
  \ is a simple mathematic formalism which relates</span> <span m='1026000'>the difference\
  \ in free energies with the equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='1032000'>Here we\
  \ might have a situation where 80% of the molecules end up at</span> <span m='1038000'>equilibrium\
  \ over here and 20% end up here. Or, we might end up as a</span> <span m='1044000'>state\
  \ where 99. % of the molecules end up here and 0.</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>%\
  \ of the molecules end up here. But that ultimate equilibrium state</span> <span\
  \ m='1054000'>is no way influenced by the enzyme. They just make it happen in</span>\
  \ <span m='1058000'>real-time. And, therefore, to repeat and echo a</span> <span\
  \ m='1062000'>point I made last time, if most biochemical reactions are to</span>\
  \ <span m='1066000'>occur in real-time, i.e., in the order of seconds or</span>\
  \ <span m='1070000'>minutes, an enzyme has to be around to make sure they happen.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1074000'>In the absence of such an enzyme of its intermediation,</span>\
  \ <span m='1078000'>it just won't happen in real-time. Even though, in principle,</span>\
  \ <span m='1082000'>it's energetically favored. So, let's just keep that very much</span>\
  \ <span m='1086000'>in mind in the course of discussions that happen. And let's\
  \ just begin</span> <span m='1091000'>now to look at an important energy-generating\
  \ reaction in the</span> <span m='1095000'>cell which is called glycolysis. We already\
  \ know the prefix glycol.</span> </p><p><span m='1100000'>Glyco refers to sugar.\
  \ And lysis, L-Y-S-I-S refers to the breakdown of</span> <span m='1104000'>a certain\
  \ compound. I am not going to ask you,</span> <span m='1109000'>nor is anyone else\
  \ in the room going to ask you to memorize this</span> <span m='1113000'>sequence\
  \ of reactions. But I'd like you to look at it and</span> <span m='1117000'>see\
  \ what take-home lessons we can distill out of that,</span> <span m='1121000'>what\
  \ wisdom we can learn from looking at such a complex series of</span> <span m='1125000'>reactions.\
  \ Perhaps, the first thing we can learn is that</span> <span m='1129000'>when we\
  \ think about biochemical reactions, we don't think of them as</span> <span m='1133000'>happening\
  \ in isolation. Here I'm talking about,</span> <span m='1137000'>for example, in\
  \ this case I could be talking A plus B going to C plus D,</span> <span m='1141000'>and\
  \ there might be a back reaction to reach equilibrium.</span> </p><p><span m='1145000'>And\
  \ we're just isolating that simple reaction from all others around it.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1149000'>But in the real world in living cells most reactions are parts of</span>\
  \ <span m='1153000'>very long pathways where each of these steps here indicates\
  \ one of</span> <span m='1157000'>the others, a step in the pathway. What we're\
  \ interested in here is</span> <span m='1161000'>how glucose, which I advertised\
  \ two lectures ago as being an important</span> <span m='1165000'>energy source,\
  \ is actually broken down.</span> </p><p><span m='1170000'>How does the cell harvest\
  \ the energy, which is inherent in glucose,</span> <span m='1174000'>in order to\
  \ generate, among other things, ATP, which we've said</span> <span m='1178000'>repeatedly\
  \ is the energy currency? ATP is used by hundreds of</span> <span m='1182000'>different\
  \ biochemical reactions in order to make them happen.</span> </p><p><span m='1187000'>These\
  \ other biochemical reactions are endergonic,</span> <span m='1191000'>they require\
  \ the investment of energy, and almost invariably,</span> <span m='1195000'>but\
  \ not invariably, but almost invariably the cell will grab hold</span> <span m='1199000'>of\
  \ an ATP molecule, break it down usually to AMP or ADP.</span> </p><p><span m='1204000'>And\
  \ then utilize the energy, which derives from breaking down ATP,</span> <span m='1208000'>it\
  \ will invest that energy in an endergonic reaction,</span> <span m='1213000'>which\
  \ in the otherwise would not happen. So, here we reach the idea</span> <span m='1218000'>that\
  \ perhaps by investing energy in a reaction, the equilibrium is</span> <span m='1223000'>shifted.\
  \ Because by investing energy, actually,</span> <span m='1228000'>the cell is able\
  \ to lower the free energy state between these two.</span> </p><p><span m='1233000'>And\
  \ that makes it possible for their equilibrium to be much more favored.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1236000'>Let's look at this glycolytic pathway. Glycolytic refers,</span> <span\
  \ m='1240000'>obviously, to glycolysis. And here we start out with glucose.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1244000'>We're drawing it out flat rather than the circular structure\
  \ we</span> <span m='1248000'>talked about last time. And let's look at what happens\
  \ here,</span> <span m='1252000'>again, not because anyone wants you to memorize\
  \ this,</span> <span m='1256000'>but because some of the details are in themselves\
  \ very illustrative.</span> </p><p><span m='1260000'>The goal of this exercise is\
  \ to create ATP for the cell,</span> <span m='1264000'>but the first step in the\
  \ reaction is actually totally</span> <span m='1268000'>counterproductive. Look\
  \ at the first thing that</span> <span m='1272000'>happens. The first thing that\
  \ happens is that the cell invests an</span> <span m='1276000'>ATP molecule to make\
  \ glucose-6-phosphate.</span> </p><p><span m='1280000'>I've advertised the goal\
  \ of this is to generate ATP from ADP,</span> <span m='1284000'>adenosine diphosphate.\
  \ But the first thing here,</span> <span m='1288000'>this is an endergonic reaction\
  \ in which the cell invests energy to</span> <span m='1292000'>create this molecule\
  \ here. So, this doesn't make sense.</span> </p><p><span m='1295000'>But ostensively\
  \ it must make sense, at one level or another, because you</span> <span m='1298000'>and\
  \ I, we're all here, and everybody in this room,</span> <span m='1302000'>at least\
  \ this moment is metabolically active.</span> </p><p><span m='1305000'>All right.\
  \ So, we've got this molecule here,</span> <span m='1308000'>glucose-6-phosphate.\
  \ And this can isomerize.</span> </p><p><span m='1311000'>You see, here's glucose-6-phosphate,\
  \ fructose-6-phosphate.</span> </p><p><span m='1315000'>And, the fact of the matter\
  \ is, there's no oxidation reduction</span> <span m='1318000'>reaction here. It's\
  \ just an isomerization.</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>And this molecule and this\
  \ molecule are virtually in the same free</span> <span m='1326000'>energy state.\
  \ It happens to be the case that their profile will look</span> <span m='1330000'>very\
  \ much like the one I drew you before. Their energy profile will</span> <span m='1334000'>look\
  \ like this. And one needs an enzyme to lower it,</span> <span m='1338000'>but there's\
  \ no energy that needs to be invested in converting one to the</span> <span m='1342000'>other\
  \ because they're very similar molecules and therefore incomparable</span> <span\
  \ m='1346000'>free energy states. Now look at the next step.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1351000'>The next step is again another ostensively totally</span> <span m='1355000'>counterproductive\
  \ way of generating energy. Because,</span> <span m='1359000'>once again, ATP, the\
  \ gamma-phosphate, its energy is invested in creating a</span> <span m='1364000'>dephosphorylated\
  \ hexose, fructose 1, 6-diphosphate where the</span> <span m='1368000'>numbers refer\
  \ obviously to the identities of the carbon.</span> </p><p><span m='1372000'>And\
  \ now we have a dephosphorylated fructose molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='1377000'>And\
  \ so here you can actually see what the three-dimensional,</span> <span m='1381000'>what\
  \ we would imagine closer to what the three-dimensional structures of</span> <span\
  \ m='1385000'>these molecules look like. And we shouldn't focus this time on</span>\
  \ <span m='1389000'>whether it's this or this. For all practical purposes,</span>\
  \ <span m='1393000'>let's just focus on this pathway here. And here,</span> <span\
  \ m='1397000'>for the first time, what now happens is that this hexose</span> <span\
  \ m='1401000'>is broken down into two trioses, i.e., into two three carbon sugars.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1405000'>And this is a slightly exergonic reaction.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1410000'>It yields, it happens without the investment of energy.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1413000'>And there's an enzyme, once again, that's required in order</span>\
  \ <span m='1417000'>to catalyze it. But let's be really clear now.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1420000'>Now we have to follow the fate of two molecules.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1424000'>The first triose and the second triose. They have different names,</span>\
  \ <span m='1427000'>but we're not going to focus on the names. One thing you notice\
  \ about</span> <span m='1431000'>these trioses is that they're readily interconvertible.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1434000'>Once again, we can image that we have a situation that</span>\
  \ <span m='1438000'>looks like this. These are flipping back and forth.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1442000'>And therefore, for all practical purposes from our point of view,</span>\
  \ <span m='1446000'>these two are equivalent because they can be exchanged virtually</span>\
  \ <span m='1450000'>instantaneously one with the other. Now, so far we've actually\
  \ expended</span> <span m='1454000'>energy. We haven't harvested energy. But, keep\
  \ in mind,</span> <span m='1459000'>the old economic dictum; you have to invest\
  \ money to make money.</span> </p><p><span m='1463000'>And that's what's going on\
  \ here. The first thing that happens is we</span> <span m='1467000'>have an oxidation\
  \ reaction. What's an oxidation reaction?</span> </p><p><span m='1472000'>We want\
  \ to strip some electrons, a pair of electrons off of this</span> <span m='1476000'>particular\
  \ triose, the 3 carbon sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>And by stripping off\
  \ a pair of electrons we donate the electrons</span> <span m='1486000'>from NAD+\
  \ to NADH. And here these structures are given</span> <span m='1490000'>in your\
  \ book. But NADH, it turns out, is the electrons are</span> <span m='1495000'>pulled\
  \ away from the triose and they're used to reduce NAD+ to NADH.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1500000'>Keep in mind that in an oxidation reaction, one molecule that's being</span>\
  \ <span m='1504000'>oxidized is deprived, is denied a pair of electrons.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1508000'>The other molecule that's being reduced, in this case\
  \ NAD,</span> <span m='1512000'>acquires a pair of electrons. And you can focus,\
  \ if you want,</span> <span m='1516000'>about the charge of these molecules, one\
  \ or the other. But, keep in mind,</span> <span m='1520000'>that in these oxidation\
  \ reduction reactions, whether it's plus charged</span> <span m='1524000'>or minus\
  \ charged is irrelevant. The real name of the game is the</span> <span m='1528000'>electrons.\
  \ Forget about the protons,</span> <span m='1531000'>whether it has a plus charge\
  \ or it's neutral. The real name of the game</span> <span m='1535000'>here is that\
  \ two electrons are being used to reduce this molecule to this.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1538000'>By the way, third mistake I forgot to tell you before,</span> <span\
  \ m='1542000'>there's a double-bond in one of the pyrimidines in the book that doesn't</span>\
  \ <span m='1545000'>make any sense. Whoever finds it gets a prize,</span> <span\
  \ m='1549000'>but no one's figured out what the prize is yet. So,</span> <span m='1553000'>this\
  \ double bond gets reduced. You see the difference between this</span> <span m='1556000'>and\
  \ this over here. And this NADH, it turns out,</span> <span m='1560000'>is a high\
  \ energy molecule. The street value of NADH is three</span> <span m='1564000'>ATPs,\
  \ i.e., in the mitochondria NADH can be used to generate three ATPs,</span> <span\
  \ m='1570000'>and that's worth something. So, NADH on its own is a high energy</span>\
  \ <span m='1575000'>molecule. It can't be used for that many things, but it can\
  \ be pulled</span> <span m='1580000'>into the mitochondria where it's converted\
  \ to three ATPs.</span> </p><p><span m='1586000'>So, we say, well, we're starting\
  \ to make some money out of this</span> <span m='1591000'>investment because we've\
  \ made, in fact, these NADHs.</span> </p><p><span m='1597000'>See right here. Why\
  \ do we say two NADHs?</span> </p><p><span m='1601000'>Because there are two trioses\
  \ we're working with, and each one of the</span> <span m='1606000'>trioses gives\
  \ you an NADH. So, everything that's going on</span> <span m='1610000'>after this,\
  \ starting from the top here, is now double because we're</span> <span m='1615000'>looking\
  \ at the parallel behaviors of two identical three carbon sugars.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1619000'>So, here we've so far generated, in principle, six ATPs.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1624000'>How much did we invest already up to this point? Two.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1628000'>We invested two but we harvested six. Already we're starting to make</span>\
  \ <span m='1633000'>a little money because I told you the street value of an NADH\
  \ is three</span> <span m='1638000'>ATPs on the black market. OK, so what happens\
  \ next?</span> </p><p><span m='1643000'>Next is another good thing. Each of the\
  \ trioses, one can</span> <span m='1647000'>actually cause each of the trioses to\
  \ generate an ATP molecule</span> <span m='1652000'>from an ADP. What happens here?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1656000'>It turns out that this phosphate over here is actually\
  \ in a pretty</span> <span m='1660000'>high energy state, in no small part because\
  \ of electron</span> <span m='1663000'>negative-negative repulsion. And by stripping\
  \ this phosphate off</span> <span m='1667000'>this high energy phosphate stripped\
  \ off of this molecule here,</span> <span m='1671000'>whose name we will ignore,\
  \ allows us to phosphorylate an ATP.</span> </p><p><span m='1674000'>And since there\
  \ are two trioses being converted, we're</span> <span m='1678000'>going to get two\
  \ ATPs. So, in effect,</span> <span m='1682000'>now we're actually ahead. We started\
  \ out investing two,</span> <span m='1686000'>we got six back from the NADHs, and\
  \ we're getting two back here.</span> </p><p><span m='1690000'>So, we've made two\
  \ ATPs. This is a good thing. Keep in mind,</span> <span m='1694000'>ADP is lower\
  \ energy, ATP is a high energy. Once again,</span> <span m='1699000'>we have an\
  \ isomerization where these two molecules are at comparable</span> <span m='1703000'>states\
  \ here and here, where the phosphate just jumps over</span> <span m='1707000'>to\
  \ this state. And this hydrolyzes spontaneously</span> <span m='1712000'>and we\
  \ get this molecule right over here, phosphoenolpyruvate at the end.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1717000'>And, once again, we harvest two ATPs,</span> <span m='1722000'>one\
  \ ATP from each of the trioses. And we end up, at the end of this</span> <span m='1727000'>reaction,\
  \ with pyruvate. And you'll say this is terrific</span> <span m='1732000'>because\
  \ we invested two ATPs, we harvested four, plus we got six</span> <span m='1737000'>from\
  \ the NADHs, right? Two NADHs, each NADH gives us three</span> <span m='1743000'>each,\
  \ so let's do the arithmetic. Let's do the balance sheet. We</span> <span m='1751000'>invested\
  \ to begin with, with the one glucose, we invested</span> <span m='1758000'>two\
  \ ATPs. That was early on. Then the return was first two NADHs,</span> <span m='1766000'>which\
  \ I've told you equals six ATPs. Because an NADH is worth three ATPs.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1773000'>This is so far good. And now subsequently we've made four ATPs so</span>\
  \ <span m='1779000'>that the net yield looks pretty useful. Six plus four is ten\
  \ minus</span> <span m='1786000'>two, a profit of eight ATPs from one glucose molecule.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1792000'>This is terrific you may say, but there's a rub.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1799000'>There's a catch. If glycolysis is occurring in the</span>\
  \ <span m='1804000'>absence of oxygen, if that happens, then we have a</span> <span\
  \ m='1810000'>problem here, because the only way that these NADHs can generate ATP\
  \ is</span> <span m='1815000'>if there is oxygen around to take these electron pairs\
  \ and use them to</span> <span m='1821000'>reduce an oxygen molecule. That is, by\
  \ the way, part of the</span> <span m='1827000'>reason we breathe. Keep in mind\
  \ that when you generate</span> <span m='1832000'>an NADH from an NAD molecule,\
  \ you need to regenerate the NAD.</span> </p><p><span m='1836000'>You can't just\
  \ accumulate more and more NADHs. You need to regenerate</span> <span m='1840000'>the\
  \ NAD. And, therefore, this NADH,</span> <span m='1844000'>with their electron pairs,\
  \ the electron pairs have some to be</span> <span m='1848000'>disposed of. You have\
  \ to regenerate NAD. You can't just make more and</span> <span m='1852000'>more\
  \ and more of this. So, how do cells get rid of it?</span> </p><p><span m='1856000'>Well,\
  \ how they get rid of it is simple.</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>You take the\
  \ electron pairs and you slap them onto oxygen,</span> <span m='1865000'>and that's\
  \ really called combustion. And you get a lot of energy out of</span> <span m='1870000'>that.\
  \ But what happens if all of this is occurring anaerobically?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1876000'>Anaerobically means the reaction is occurring in the absence of oxygen.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1881000'>Well, if you have a yeast that's growing 14 feet underground,</span>\
  \ <span m='1887000'>this is happening anaerobically. If you have a yeast that's</span>\
  \ <span m='1891000'>fermenting in a big keg to make wine or beer, it's also probably</span>\
  \ <span m='1895000'>happening anaerobically. If you start running in a 100 yard</span>\
  \ <span m='1899000'>sprint, or let's say you had to run a mile, then initially there's</span>\
  \ <span m='1903000'>enough oxygen, there's a lot of oxygen around to</span> <span\
  \ m='1907000'>allow you to get rid of these NADHs and dump the electrons that they</span>\
  \ <span m='1911000'>have acquired onto the oxygen molecule. And that's fine.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1915000'>That's worth a lot because, in effect, what you're doing\
  \ is</span> <span m='1919000'>you're taking oxygen and hydrogen and you're combusting\
  \ them together.</span> </p><p><span m='1923000'>And that's great. But as you start\
  \ running down the</span> <span m='1927000'>street, soon the oxygen supply to your\
  \ muscles is going to run out,</span> <span m='1932000'>and soon a lot of the energy\
  \ production in your muscles happens</span> <span m='1936000'>anaerobically. Why?\
  \ Because you can't get oxygen</span> <span m='1941000'>quickly enough to your muscles,\
  \ and therefore, for a period of time,</span> <span m='1946000'>you start feeling\
  \ that burning sensation in your muscles because</span> <span m='1950000'>oxidation\
  \ of NADH isn't happening. And these NADHs instead are</span> <span m='1955000'>regenerated\
  \ by another way. How are they regenerated? The</span> <span m='1960000'>electron\
  \ pairs of the NADHs, must be, are dumped back onto this</span> <span m='1965000'>molecule\
  \ right here, pyruvate. They're not used to make</span> <span m='1970000'>ATP because\
  \ they can't be used to make ATP because there's no oxygen</span> <span m='1975000'>around\
  \ to accept the electron pairs that these NADHs have acquired.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1981000'>And so, what happens with these valuable NADHs?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1985000'>Under anaerobic conditions this doesn't happen.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1989000'>These NADHs are used instead, their electrons are donated to our</span>\
  \ <span m='1994000'>friend pyruvate here, these three carbon sugar.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1998000'>And what happens, when they are donated back to the pyruvate,</span>\
  \ <span m='2003000'>in order to regenerate NAD you need more NAD to pick up to use\
  \ later in</span> <span m='2007000'>the reaction, to use over again in another reaction.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2012000'>When you donate the electrons from NADH back onto pyruvate,</span>\
  \ <span m='2016000'>what happens? You get lactic acid. Lactic acid is what makes\
  \ your</span> <span m='2021000'>muscles burn when you're running very quickly and\
  \ you can't get</span> <span m='2025000'>enough oxygen into them to begin to burn\
  \ up the NADH.</span> </p><p><span m='2030000'>So, instead of using NADH to generate\
  \ ATP, it's diverted to make</span> <span m='2035000'>lactic acid. That's in one\
  \ sense good because you regenerate NAD.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Why do\
  \ you need to regenerate NAD? Because you need a lot of NAD</span> <span m='2044000'>around\
  \ for the earlier steps in the reaction. Keep in mind,</span> <span m='2049000'>early\
  \ in the reaction you need NAD here. If you don't regenerate it</span> <span m='2053000'>then\
  \ glycolysis grinds to a halt. So, even though you make NADH and</span> <span m='2058000'>it's\
  \ a good thing in principle, in practice it has to be recycled.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2063000'>And if it's not recycled to make more new NAD to allow this step to</span>\
  \ <span m='2067000'>happen then the whole glycolytic reaction will shut down</span>\
  \ <span m='2072000'>and you're in a mess. However, sadly,</span> <span m='2077000'>in\
  \ the absence of oxygen, the only way to recycle this is to</span> <span m='2081000'>dump\
  \ these electrons not onto oxygen which is energy rich,</span> <span m='2086000'>it's\
  \ dump them back onto pyruvic acid creating lactic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='2090000'>So,\
  \ you reduce this bond right here. So, you get CH,</span> <span m='2095000'>COH.\
  \ This bond right here is reduced and you get lactic acid.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>So,\
  \ instead of a carbonyl bond here you have CH and COH right here,</span> <span m='2104000'>that's\
  \ a reduction reaction. And now you're able to regenerate the</span> <span m='2109000'>NAD.\
  \ And now you say that's a great thing. But, keep in mind,</span> <span m='2113000'>that\
  \ now the entire glycolytic reaction, how much is our net profit</span> <span m='2118000'>now?\
  \ Before I was gloating about the fact that we made eight ATPs,</span> <span m='2123000'>we\
  \ netted eight ATPs out of this. What are we back down to now?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2127000'>What's the whole net yield now? Well, the TAs can't answer.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2132000'>It's two, because we invested two and we got out four.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2136000'>And it's only two. Now, why is this so interesting?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2140000'>Well, until about six hundred million years ago there\
  \ wasn't that</span> <span m='2145000'>much oxygen in the atmosphere. And in the\
  \ absence of oxygen this</span> <span m='2149000'>is almost the only reaction that\
  \ could be used in order to generate</span> <span m='2154000'>energy. And about\
  \ six hundred million years ago more and more</span> <span m='2158000'>oxygen from\
  \ photosynthesis became dumped into the atmosphere.</span> </p><p><span m='2163000'>And\
  \ soon oxygen became available to organisms like our ancestors.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2168000'>And then they could actually begin to recycle this NADH in a much\
  \ more</span> <span m='2173000'>productive way. And as a consequence what happened,</span>\
  \ <span m='2178000'>instead of having glycolysis yielding two, we could go up to\
  \ this</span> <span m='2183000'>theoretical eight because the NADHs could now deposit\
  \ their electrons on</span> <span m='2188000'>oxygen, which is much more profitable.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2193000'>In fact, I've just told you now that in the absence of\
  \ oxygen you can</span> <span m='2199000'>only make two ATPs. I will tell you, without\
  \ providing</span> <span m='2205000'>it to you, that in the presence of oxygen you\
  \ can make 34 ATPs.</span> </p><p><span m='2211000'>And 34 is, we can agree, much\
  \ better than two in the</span> <span m='2217000'>presence of oxygen. Higher life\
  \ forms could not evolve</span> <span m='2221000'>until this much more effective\
  \ way of generating energy became</span> <span m='2225000'>available. And, therefore,\
  \ if our ancestors who</span> <span m='2229000'>lived longer than six hundred million\
  \ years ago were very sluggish</span> <span m='2233000'>and they weren't very smart,\
  \ the reason why they were sluggish</span> <span m='2237000'>and they weren't very\
  \ smart is because they couldn't generate the</span> <span m='2241000'>energy that\
  \ was required to efficiently drive metabolism.</span> </p><p><span m='2245000'>The\
  \ metabolism, anaerobic metabolism, i.</span> </p><p><span m='2249000'>., occurring\
  \ in the absence of energy, is extremely inefficient.</span> </p><p><span m='2253000'>It\
  \ just doesn't happen very well. Now, what actually happens if we</span> <span m='2259000'>have\
  \ oxygen around? Well, what happens is something</span> <span m='2265000'>like this.\
  \ We take the pyruvate, which is the product of glycolysis</span> <span m='2271000'>and\
  \ which is this much more primitive pathway,</span> <span m='2277000'>and we dump\
  \ it into the mitochondria. And now we generate through this</span> <span m='2282000'>cycle\
  \ here, which I'm not asking you memorize, please,</span> <span m='2288000'>don't\
  \ do that. We generate the reactions which go from here and get</span> <span m='2293000'>us\
  \ up to this 34 ATP yield per glucose. And the essence of the</span> <span m='2299000'>citric\
  \ acid cycle, which happens in the mitochondria,</span> <span m='2304000'>keep in\
  \ mind that the mitochondria look like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2310000'>Keep\
  \ in mind that the mitochondrion are the decedents of bacteria which</span> <span\
  \ m='2314000'>parasitized the cytoplasm of cells probably 1.5 billion years ago.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2319000'>But if we now look at what happens in the mitochondrion,</span>\
  \ <span m='2323000'>the pyruvate that we generated in the cytosol, in the soluble\
  \ part of</span> <span m='2328000'>the cytoplasm is now pumped into the mitochondria,\
  \ and there's a whole</span> <span m='2333000'>series of reactions that go on here,\
  \ which takes this three-carbon</span> <span m='2337000'>sugar. The first thing\
  \ that happens is that</span> <span m='2342000'>carbon is boiled off. Carbon dioxide,\
  \ that's released.</span> </p><p><span m='2346000'>Now we're down to a two carbon\
  \ sugar. And then this two carbon</span> <span m='2350000'>sugar is added to a four\
  \ carbon sugar and progressively oxidized.</span> </p><p><span m='2354000'>And as\
  \ it's oxidized what's spun off? Well, what's spun off is,</span> <span m='2359000'>for\
  \ example, there's NADH which is spun off, there's ATP.</span> </p><p><span m='2363000'>See,\
  \ there's an NADH which is spun off. Here's an NADH that's spun off.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2367000'>Here is a cousin of NADH. It's called FADH which,</span> <span m='2372000'>once\
  \ again, generates a high energy molecule. Once again,</span> <span m='2376000'>the\
  \ carbon molecules are oxidized, electrons are stripped away and used</span> <span\
  \ m='2381000'>to create these high energy molecules, FADH and NADH.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2385000'>By the way, FADH, a cousin of NADH, is only worth two ATPs on the\
  \ open</span> <span m='2389000'>market. Whereas, NADH, as I've told you repeatedly,</span>\
  \ <span m='2394000'>is worth three. And by the time we add up all of the NADHs that\
  \ have</span> <span m='2398000'>been generated by this cycling and the carbon dioxides\
  \ that are</span> <span m='2403000'>releases, at the end of this cycle here we start\
  \ with two carbons,</span> <span m='2407000'>add it to four and we get a six carbon\
  \ molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='2412000'>We spew off some carbon dioxides here\
  \ and go back to four carbon</span> <span m='2416000'>sugar. Add another two, go\
  \ up to six carbons. Go around</span> <span m='2420000'>again, spin around the wheel.\
  \ And each time we do that we</span> <span m='2424000'>generate a lot of NADHs,\
  \ we generate a lot of FADHs,</span> <span m='2428000'>and we generate a lot of\
  \ ATP. In all cases, these are highly</span> <span m='2433000'>profitable reactions\
  \ simply because the NADHs and the FADHs can be used</span> <span m='2439000'>in\
  \ the mitochondrion to generate ATP. So, let's look at the energy</span> <span m='2445000'>profile\
  \ of the entire thing. Put it all together. This is where</span> <span m='2451000'>we\
  \ started out at the beginning, and this is the end of glycolysis,</span> <span\
  \ m='2457000'>OK? So, now we're adding up the energy</span> <span m='2462000'>profiles\
  \ of the whole sequence of reactions that constituted</span> <span m='2466000'>glycolysis,\
  \ which begins up here and ends right here because pyruvate,</span> <span m='2470000'>as\
  \ you will recall, is the product of glycolysis,</span> <span m='2474000'>the first\
  \ step. The Krebs Cycle happens,</span> <span m='2478000'>or sometimes it's called\
  \ the Citric Acid Cycle. So,</span> <span m='2482000'>let's just get these words\
  \ straight. Citric Acid Cycle because it</span> <span m='2486000'>happens to be\
  \ one of the cycles, or it's sometimes called the Krebs</span> <span m='2490000'>Cycle\
  \ after the person who really discovered it, Krebs.</span> </p><p><span m='2495000'>The\
  \ Krebs Cycle begins here. You see how the shading changes</span> <span m='2499000'>from\
  \ pyruvate. And here we go all the way down</span> <span m='2503000'>there. And\
  \ let's now look at what happens in terms of energy exchange.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2507000'>Recall that early on we needed to invest ATPs to kick up the energy</span>\
  \ <span m='2511000'>state up to here. We invested ATPs at this stage</span> <span\
  \ m='2515000'>right here, and then we began to get some back.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2520000'>We got these two NADHs, one NADH coming from each of the</span> <span\
  \ m='2524000'>three carbon sugars. We got some more ATPs here and we</span> <span\
  \ m='2528000'>got some more ATPs here, but these NADHs could not be used</span>\
  \ <span m='2532000'>productively for generating ATP in the absence of oxygen,</span>\
  \ <span m='2537000'>but in the presence of oxygen now we can begin to use these\
  \ very</span> <span m='2541000'>profitably. Each of these makes three ATPs and each\
  \ of these,</span> <span m='2545000'>obviously, makes ATPs. And then let's look\
  \ at what happens</span> <span m='2550000'>in the mitochondrion. Keep in mind here's\
  \ the borderline</span> <span m='2554000'>between the cytosol, the cytoplasm and\
  \ the mitochondrion.</span> </p><p><span m='2558000'>Here is where the oxygen is\
  \ actually used and here we generate</span> <span m='2562000'>all these NADHs here,\
  \ here and here, FADHs. And I keep</span> <span m='2566000'>saying, and it's still\
  \ true, just in spite of the fact I keep</span> <span m='2570000'>saying it, that\
  \ these NADHs can be converted to ATPs,</span> <span m='2574000'>and the ATPs can\
  \ then be diffused, transmitted throughout the entire</span> <span m='2578000'>cell\
  \ where they're then used invested in endergonic reactions.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2582000'>Here we see all these NADHs. And look at the overall change in</span>\
  \ <span m='2586000'>free energy. The initial steps in glycolysis didn't really take</span>\
  \ <span m='2591000'>advantage. Glucose has inherent in it almost 680 kilocalories\
  \ per mole</span> <span m='2595000'>of energy. It's pretty high up here. But by\
  \ the time we get from here</span> <span m='2600000'>down to here, there's an enormous\
  \ release of energy,</span> <span m='2605000'>it's harvested in the form of these\
  \ molecules which are then reinvested.</span> </p><p><span m='2610000'>In the absence\
  \ of oxygen, this entire procedure can only go</span> <span m='2614000'>from here\
  \ down to here. And a lot of this drop from six to</span> <span m='2618000'>seven\
  \ is futile because we have to reinvest this NADH.</span> </p><p><span m='2622000'>These\
  \ cannot be used, actually, to generate more ATPs,</span> <span m='2627000'>as I've\
  \ said repeatedly. So, this means in the end that we can</span> <span m='2631000'>generate\
  \ an enormous amount of energy in the form of these</span> <span m='2635000'>coupled\
  \ reactions. Having said that,</span> <span m='2641000'>let's actually look at what\
  \ happens inside of the mitochondria.</span> </p><p><span m='2648000'>Inside of\
  \ the mitochondria there are actually different physical</span> <span m='2655000'>compartments.\
  \ See the blue space there, the intermembrane space,</span> <span m='2662000'>the\
  \ blue spaces there? The matrix is on the inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2670000'>The\
  \ intermembrane space is between the two, the inner and the outer</span> <span m='2675000'>membrane,\
  \ and outside is the cytoplasm. The outer membrane,</span> <span m='2680000'>the\
  \ inner membrane, in between it. So, look what happens, actually, in</span> <span\
  \ m='2685000'>the mitochondrion. Those NADHs are used to pump</span> <span m='2690000'>protons\
  \ from the inner space of the mitochondrion into the intermembrane</span> <span\
  \ m='2695000'>space. I'm not showing you that happening.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>But\
  \ you'll have to take it on my word. So, protons pictured here are</span> <span\
  \ m='2705000'>extracted from NADH and FADH, and they're used to pump protons out</span>\
  \ <span m='2710000'>here. And, therefore, protons are moved from here to here.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2715000'>Obviously, when you pump protons out the pH gets lower\
  \ on the outside</span> <span m='2720000'>than it does on the inside, and because\
  \ there's a gradient,</span> <span m='2725000'>there's a higher concentration of\
  \ protons here than on the inside.</span> </p><p><span m='2730000'>The protons begin\
  \ to accumulate outside here in the intermembrane</span> <span m='2734000'>space.\
  \ Are they in the cytoplasm? No. They're in the space between</span> <span m='2739000'>the\
  \ inner and the outer membrane. You start to accumulate in this</span> <span m='2744000'>blue\
  \ space lots of protons. And this pumping of protons into</span> <span m='2749000'>the\
  \ space between the two membranes requires energy,</span> <span m='2754000'>and\
  \ the energy comes from our friends NADH and FADH</span> <span m='2759000'>as it\
  \ turns out. They are responsible for causing</span> <span m='2764000'>this accumulation\
  \ of protons in the space between the inner and the</span> <span m='2768000'>outer\
  \ membrane. So, now we get lots of protons out</span> <span m='2772000'>there. And\
  \ what happens now, the protons like to flow back in</span> <span m='2776000'>because\
  \ there is a higher concentration here as they are</span> <span m='2780000'>inside\
  \ the space that's called the mitochondrial matrix,</span> <span m='2784000'>on\
  \ the inside of the mitochondrion. So, what happens?</span> </p><p><span m='2789000'>Here,\
  \ yet another Nobel Prize winning discovery is the discovery</span> <span m='2792000'>of\
  \ a very interesting molecule, or complex of proteins I should say,</span> <span\
  \ m='2796000'>that looks in three-dimensions roughly like this.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2800000'>And what this complex does is as the protons flow through the inner</span>\
  \ <span m='2804000'>channel here, they're moving down an energy gradient.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2808000'>They're going from a state of high concentration to a\
  \ state of low</span> <span m='2812000'>concentration. What that does,</span> <span\
  \ m='2816000'>that diffusional pressure actually yields energy.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2820000'>And this complex right here harvests that energy in order to convert\
  \ ADP</span> <span m='2825000'>into ATP. So, when I talk about NADH as being</span>\
  \ <span m='2830000'>worth, each of them being worth three ATPs, what I'm really\
  \ talking</span> <span m='2835000'>about is the fact that NADHs can be used to pump\
  \ protons in the</span> <span m='2840000'>mitochondria outside here, and these protons\
  \ can then be used,</span> <span m='2845000'>can then be pumped, can then flow in\
  \ this way through this proton pump,</span> <span m='2851000'>which then uses ADP\
  \ in the inner cavity of the mitochondria</span> <span m='2856000'>to create ATP.\
  \ And here we get finally the</span> <span m='2860000'>conversion of ADP into ATP.\
  \ We can realize, finally, this much</span> <span m='2864000'>promised benefit.\
  \ And then these ATP molecules are</span> <span m='2868000'>exported from the mitochondria\
  \ throughout the entire cell and used</span> <span m='2872000'>to drive many reactions.\
  \ We've already encountered one</span> <span m='2876000'>important set of reactions,\
  \ and those reactions are the</span> <span m='2880000'>polymerization of nucleic\
  \ acids. Now, one final point I want to make</span> <span m='2884000'>is the following.\
  \ We've just talked about metabolic,</span> <span m='2888000'>we've talked about\
  \ the pathway of energy production in the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2892000'>And\
  \ you might have had the illusion, for a brief instant,</span> <span m='2896000'>that\
  \ those are all, that's the sum of all the biochemical reactions in</span> <span\
  \ m='2900000'>the cell. But, in fact, if we plot out all the</span> <span m='2904000'>biochemical\
  \ reactions in the cell, they're much more complicated. Here</span> <span m='2908000'>is\
  \ the glycolytic pathway. You see it right down here where</span> <span m='2911000'>nothing\
  \ is named? Here is the Krebs Cycle right here.</span> </p><p><span m='2915000'>And\
  \ we're not even talking about energy here. And as molecules move</span> <span m='2919000'>down\
  \ this pathway from here to here to here to here,</span> <span m='2923000'>some\
  \ of these molecules are diverted for other applications.</span> </p><p><span m='2926000'>Not\
  \ for energy production but for other applications.</span> </p><p><span m='2930000'>And\
  \ what happens out here, they are converted through a series</span> <span m='2934000'>of\
  \ complex biochemical steps into other essential biological</span> <span m='2938000'>molecules.\
  \ What do I mean by that?</span> </p><p><span m='2942000'>If you give E. coli, a\
  \ bacterium, you give it a simple carbon source</span> <span m='2946000'>like glucose\
  \ and you give it phosphate and you give it a simple</span> <span m='2950000'>nitrogen\
  \ source like ammonium acetate or something,</span> <span m='2954000'>E. coli can,\
  \ from those simple atoms generate all the amino acids,</span> <span m='2959000'>can\
  \ generate the purines and the pyrimidines, can generate all kinds</span> <span\
  \ m='2963000'>of different complex biological molecules just from those</span> <span\
  \ m='2967000'>simple building blocks. And so, the process of biosynthesis</span>\
  \ <span m='2973000'>involves not only the creation of macromolecules,</span> <span\
  \ m='2980000'>these steps of what are called intermediary metabolism are used to</span>\
  \ <span m='2987000'>synthesize all the other biochemical entities that one needs\
  \ to make a</span> <span m='2994000'>cell. They're used to synthesize purines and\
  \ pyrimidines.</span> </p><p><span m='3001000'>They're used to synthesize lipids,\
  \ they're used to synthesize amino</span> <span m='3005000'>acids, and they're used\
  \ to synthesize literally hundreds of</span> <span m='3009000'>other compounds.\
  \ And when we see this chart like</span> <span m='3013000'>this, and nobody on the\
  \ face of the planet has ever memorized this chart,</span> <span m='3018000'>each\
  \ one of these steps, going from one molecule to the next,</span> <span m='3022000'>represents\
  \ another biochemical reaction. And the vast majority of</span> <span m='3026000'>these\
  \ biochemical reactions going from A to B to C to D.</span> </p><p><span m='3031000'>Each\
  \ one of these steps requires the intervention of an enzyme,</span> <span m='3035000'>a\
  \ catalyst that is specialized for that particular step.</span> </p><p><span m='3039000'>So,\
  \ this begins to give you an appreciation of how many distinct</span> <span m='3044000'>biochemical\
  \ steps one needs in a cell. The numbers probably to make</span> <span m='3048000'>a\
  \ simple cell, you probably need about a thousand</span> <span m='3053000'>distinct\
  \ biochemical reactions, each of one of which requires the</span> <span m='3057000'>involvement\
  \ of an enzyme. And many of these steps,</span> <span m='3062000'>importantly, many\
  \ of these biochemical steps are endergonic</span> <span m='3066000'>reactions.\
  \ Where do they get the energy for driving these reactions</span> <span m='3071000'>forward\
  \ if they're endergonic? ATP. So, the ATP from the energy</span> <span m='3075000'>generating\
  \ furnace down here is the then spread throughout the cell to</span> <span m='3080000'>power\
  \ all of these energy consuming reactions. Have a great weekend.</span> </p>"
