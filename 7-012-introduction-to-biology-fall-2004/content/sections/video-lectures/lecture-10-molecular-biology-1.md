transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning. Yeah. All right. Good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='6000'>Something to counteract the rainy</span> <span m='8000'>days we have here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='12000'>All right. Today we're going to make a very important transition.</span>
  </p><p><span m='16000'>The transition goes back to this picture.</span> </p><p><span
  m='20000'>Of course, what we want to do is</span> <span m='24000'>understand biological
  function by taking our two favorite approaches.</span> </p><p><span m='28000'>Understanding
  the organism minus an individual gene.</span> </p><p><span m='31000'>Understanding
  an organism minus an individual component,</span> <span m='34000'>and understanding
  the individual components minus the organism,</span> <span m='37000'>genetics and
  biochemistry. And, as we know, the geneticist went off</span> <span m='40000'>on
  their route finding mutants, doing mutant hunts, making crosses,</span> <span m='44000'>making
  genetic maps, et cetera, didn't understand really what these</span> <span m='47000'>genes
  had to do with anything specific in the organism,</span> <span m='50000'>other than
  they produced phenotypes when they were mutated.</span> </p><p><span m='53000'>And
  the biochemist went off purifying enzymes,</span> <span m='56000'>working on biochemical
  pathways, et cetera, et cetera.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>We began to see some
  connection when we talked a bit about the mutants</span> <span m='64000'>that affect
  the ability to make arginine and the fact that they</span> <span m='68000'>could
  encode different enzymatic steps. And, in particular,</span> <span m='72000'>I highlighted
  the work of Archibald Garrett who really,</span> <span m='76000'>right at the start
  of the century, recognized that somehow genetic</span> <span m='80000'>mutations
  were responsible for somehow affecting the production of</span> <span m='84000'>enzymes
  in important biochemical pathways.</span> </p><p><span m='89000'>So, that was sort
  of one connection of genetics into protein but still a</span> <span m='93000'>rather
  tenuous one. The real next step to connect these</span> <span m='97000'>two would
  be to do the biochemistry of genes. So,</span> <span m='102000'>how would a biochemist
  approach heredity? A biochemist would grind</span> <span m='106000'>up the organism,
  fractionate it in different</span> <span m='111000'>components, and attempt to find
  heredity, purify heredity,</span> <span m='115000'>get like a pure solution of heredity.
  And that's nuts, right?</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>The notion that you could
  purify heredity as a biochemical entity</span> <span m='123000'>because like how
  would you know you had it? But, of course,</span> <span m='126000'>that's exactly
  what happened. That is what happened, was</span> <span m='129000'>biochemistry developed
  sufficiently far that folks were actually able to</span> <span m='133000'>purify
  substances, not just that could digest a</span> <span m='136000'>particular sugar
  or substances that might, you know,</span> <span m='139000'>like slide by each other
  like actinomycins of muscles,</span> <span m='143000'>but substances that were actually
  heredity. And that began the real</span> <span m='146000'>unification of those,
  and that's the point of today.</span> </p><p><span m='150000'>And that is the field
  of molecular biology. And we're going to cover</span> <span m='159000'>tremendous
  territory in unifying these two different fields.</span> </p><p><span m='168000'>OK.
  So, let's dive right in. The discovery of the transforming</span> <span m='177000'>principle.
  It's a wonderfully old-fashioned</span> <span m='184000'>kind of word. Nobody would
  use language like this today.</span> </p><p><span m='189000'>The discovery of the
  transforming principle. So,</span> <span m='194000'>this starts, this shaggy dog
  story starts in about 1928 with the work</span> <span m='199000'>of Griffiths. Griffiths
  had no particular interest in DNA or</span> <span m='204000'>genetics or biochemistry
  for that matter.</span> </p><p><span m='210000'>Griffith was interested in bacteria.
  He wanted to understand bacteria.</span> </p><p><span m='216000'>And, in particular,
  he studied pneumococcus bacteria,</span> <span m='222000'>which could infect and
  kill mice. And he was very interested in the</span> <span m='228000'>mechanism by
  with these pneumococci could kill mice.</span> </p><p><span m='234000'>Now, it turns
  out that the pneumococcus bacteria came in two</span> <span m='240000'>different
  types. One, the bacteria,</span> <span m='245000'>when they grew on a Petri plate,
  produced a glistening, smooth, shiny</span> <span m='249000'>colony. We'll call
  them smooth bacteria here.</span> </p><p><span m='254000'>And these bacteria, in
  addition to being smooth and</span> <span m='259000'>glistening, were virulent.
  That is, if you inject into the</span> <span m='263000'>mouse, these bacteria would
  kill the mouse. They are smooth because they</span> <span m='268000'>have this encapsulating
  polysaccharide coat around them.</span> </p><p><span m='273000'>And it's not necessarily
  the case that that's what makes them virulent,</span> <span m='276000'>although
  it actually does have a role in that, but it is the case</span> <span m='280000'>that
  they're smooth and they're virulent. So,</span> <span m='283000'>you inject in a
  mouse, mouse dies because the mouse is not</span> <span m='287000'>resistant to
  these bacteria. By contrast, there were strains of</span> <span m='291000'>pneumococcus
  that were rough. They did not have the same kind of</span> <span m='294000'>a polysaccharide
  coat, and therefore they had a very rough</span> <span m='298000'>appearance. They
  didn't glisten.</span> </p><p><span m='302000'>And these were non-virulent. If you
  inject these into the mouse,</span> <span m='308000'>the mouse immune system was
  able to fight these particular rough</span> <span m='313000'>bacteria. OK. So, Griffith
  did the obvious</span> <span m='319000'>experiments. So, take some bacteria,</span>
  <span m='324000'>we'll take some smooth virulent bacteria, we'll inject</span> <span
  m='330000'>into a mouse. And what will happen?</span> </p><p><span m='336000'>The
  mouse will die. This is one of the easier assays in the laboratory.</span> </p><p><span
  m='343000'>It's the feet up, feet down assay, you have a dead mouse.</span> </p><p><span
  m='350000'>OK. Number two. Then take the rough bacteria,</span> <span m='357000'>inject
  it into a mouse, what happens?</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>Sorry? It lives. The
  mouse lives because these are</span> <span m='369000'>non virulent. OK. Now, let's
  just do some simple</span> <span m='374000'>controls. Let's take the smooth bacteria
  and autoclave them,</span> <span m='378000'>heat them up to very high temperature
  to kill them.</span> </p><p><span m='383000'>How will we know they're dead? You
  try plating them out. They</span> <span m='387000'>don't grow anymore, so they're
  dead.</span> </p><p><span m='392000'>So, take heat killed, and you can verify in
  the lab that</span> <span m='397000'>they're killed, heat killed smooth,</span>
  <span m='403000'>check that they really were heat killed, inject them into the mouse.</span>
  </p><p><span m='409000'>And what happens? It lives because, I mean, they're bacteria,</span>
  <span m='414000'>right? OK. Last of all we take the utterly harmless rough bacteria,</span>
  <span m='420000'>plus the utterly harmless heat-killed smooth bacteria,</span> <span
  m='426000'>we inject them into the mouse, and what happens?</span> </p><p><span
  m='432000'>It dies. That is a notable result because the rough bacteria alone</span>
  <span m='438000'>will not kill this mouse and the smooth bacteria that have been</span>
  <span m='444000'>heat-killed will not kill this mouse, but together they killed
  the mouse.</span> </p><p><span m='450000'>This is very puzzling. What was even more
  puzzling was</span> <span m='457000'>when you autopsied the mouse, you can isolate
  from that mouse</span> <span m='464000'>smooth, virulent, live bacteria, but you
  didn't put</span> <span m='472000'>any in. Very strange. So, this actually yields
  live</span> <span m='479000'>smooth virulent bacteria despite not having put any
  in there.</span> </p><p><span m='487000'>Virulent bacteria. Somehow we were able
  to create</span> <span m='492000'>smooth and virulent bacteria notwithstanding not
  having put any</span> <span m='497000'>in here. So, of course, Griffith then attempted
  to say,</span> <span m='502000'>well, what was it that allowed this to happen?</span>
  </p><p><span m='508000'>So, he could try putting in dead rough bacteria with dead
  smooth</span> <span m='511000'>bacteria. That doesn't do anything. You need to have
  something alive.</span> </p><p><span m='515000'>So, you've got to have live rough
  bacteria. You can then say let me</span> <span m='519000'>take the dead virulent
  bacteria and start fractionating it biochemically</span> <span m='523000'>and asking
  what fraction of that material from the dead bacteria</span> <span m='526000'>allows
  us to recover, to have this property of being able</span> <span m='530000'>to now
  produce virulent bacteria that killed the mice?</span> </p><p><span m='534000'>And
  do you realize how utterly tedious and painful that</span> <span m='538000'>experiment
  is? You take the dead bacteria,</span> <span m='541000'>you fractionate it into
  lots of different biochemical fractions.</span> </p><p><span m='545000'>For each
  fraction, how do you test whether it has the property?</span> </p><p><span m='549000'>You've
  got to shoot up a bunch of mice. This is a very tedious</span> <span m='553000'>procedure.
  I mean it is, you know, you can't underestimate</span> <span m='557000'>how important
  the assay is, how important it is to come up with</span> <span m='561000'>easy ways
  to do things in order to be able to accelerate progress.</span> </p><p><span m='565000'>Griffith
  tried hard and roughly began to purify fractions and get</span> <span m='568000'>information
  about what the fractions were. But, in fact,</span> <span m='572000'>this work really
  never did lead to a clear conclusion.</span> </p><p><span m='576000'>But it did
  tell people that there was some material,</span> <span m='580000'>which got named
  The Transforming Principle. This is almost like an</span> <span m='584000'>old alchemical
  kind of word, a principle being a particular</span> <span m='588000'>chemical composition
  of matter, which if you don't know what it is</span> <span m='592000'>you call it
  The Living Principle or something like that.</span> </p><p><span m='596000'>So,
  what was this transforming principle?</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>Well, it really
  took work about 15 years later by Avery,</span> <span m='607000'>McCarty and MacLeod
  to sort this out. What Avery, McCarty and MacLeod did</span> <span m='615000'>was
  the same experiment basically, except minus the mice.</span> </p><p><span m='623000'>What
  they found was you could take the dead bacteria,</span> <span m='630000'>combine
  it, the dead virulent bacteria, the dead smooth bacteria,</span> <span m='637000'>combine
  it with the live rough bacteria, and by combining it in the</span> <span m='645000'>right
  way in a test tube you would be able to plate it out on a Petri</span> <span m='652000'>plate
  and see smooth bacteria come out.</span> </p><p><span m='660000'>Sans mouse. So,
  they didn't need the mouse.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>This dramatically accelerated
  work because if you're able to just take</span> <span m='666000'>fractions of the
  dead bacteria, add it to the live bacteria and look</span> <span m='669000'>for
  the presence of some smooth bacteria coming out of it,</span> <span m='673000'>you
  would be able to work much more quickly. And they did.</span> </p><p><span m='676000'>And
  they began purifying. And they began purifying and they</span> <span m='679000'>tried
  to isolate the fraction that contained this new ability to make</span> <span m='683000'>these
  bacteria acquire a new property. And they knew that they</span> <span m='686000'>were
  transforming the heredity of this bacterium.</span> </p><p><span m='690000'>They
  were transforming the traits of this bacterium.</span> </p><p><span m='694000'>They
  were, in fact, transmitting heredity.</span> </p><p><span m='698000'>And they purified
  and purified and purified. And eventually,</span> <span m='702000'>testing many,
  many fractions and making them purer and purer and</span> <span m='706000'>purer
  and purer, they found that consistently the</span> <span m='710000'>fraction that
  contained heredity was the fraction that contained DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='714000'>Now,
  it was a lot more work than that because no fraction is pure.</span> </p><p><span
  m='718000'>DNA is in multiple fractions. But, you know,</span> <span m='722000'>they
  kept trying to purify it. And it sure looked like the</span> <span m='726000'>transforming
  principle. The property of being able to</span> <span m='731000'>transform was co-purifying
  along with the DNA fraction.</span> </p><p><span m='736000'>And you know what the
  reaction to that was? Well,</span> <span m='740000'>mostly it was that they must
  have goofed because all smart right</span> <span m='745000'>thinking people knew
  that DNA was an absolutely boring molecule.</span> </p><p><span m='750000'>Because
  the interesting molecule at this time was proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='753000'>Everybody
  knew there were zillions, there were 20 amino acids, they came</span> <span m='756000'>in
  zillions of combinations, they had all sorts of different</span> <span m='759000'>shapes
  and properties, and hydrophobic ones, hydrophilic</span> <span m='762000'>ones that
  are enzymes. And, clearly, anything as important</span> <span m='765000'>as heredity
  was not going to be encoded in some utterly boring</span> <span m='768000'>structural
  molecule that was just a long polymer of four virtually</span> <span m='771000'>identical
  units. And so, the sort of reaction was</span> <span m='774000'>this is interesting
  but there must be some trick,</span> <span m='777000'>something must be wrong in
  this experiment, give or take.</span> </p><p><span m='780000'>Now, why did people
  think that DNA was so boring?</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>Now, DNA had been known
  for a long time, since the 1860s.</span> </p><p><span m='787000'>Lots of molecules
  were known, but why was DNA boring and why were</span> <span m='790000'>proteins
  kind of exciting? So, for that, we really do have to</span> <span m='794000'>look
  some more closely at the structure of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='797000'>I want
  to review the structure of DNA here because we're going to use</span> <span m='801000'>it
  a lot. So, DNA has three components,</span> <span m='805000'>as you undoubtedly
  know. It has first a sugar,</span> <span m='812000'>or almost sugar, two prime deoxyribose,
  two prime deoxyribose,</span> <span m='823000'>so it's a pentose, or almost the
  deoxypentose. And its structure,</span> <span m='834000'>and this is an important
  structure. In order to be a true sugar,</span> <span m='843000'>to be ribose you
  would have a hydroxyl. Deoxyribose just has a</span> <span m='850000'>hydrogen there.
  And the way we number these carbons</span> <span m='856000'>around this five carbon
  sugar are very important and we'll always talk</span> <span m='863000'>about them,
  the one prime, two prime, three prime, four prime</span> <span m='870000'>and five
  prime carbons of this deoxyribose.</span> </p><p><span m='877000'>And you'll notice
  that it's the two prime carbon that is dioxi.</span> </p><p><span m='882000'>So,
  that's the sugar. The next important component as we build up</span> <span m='888000'>DNA
  is the base, OK? The base is put here.</span> </p><p><span m='894000'>Now, I'm going
  to start simplifying our sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>Base. So, there are
  four kinds of bases that can go here.</span> </p><p><span m='915000'>And they are
  adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine.</span> </p><p><span m='930000'>So, that's the
  second important part of building up DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='938000'>The third
  important part in building up DNA is to make the</span> <span m='947000'>monomers
  that are used to produce DNA, we need to put on</span> <span m='955000'>a triphosphate.
  And he we go. We'll take our sugar</span> <span m='967000'>here, our base over here,
  and then off this carbon we have our</span> <span m='982000'>phosphate. And we have
  a triphosphate.</span> </p><p><span m='995000'>There we go. So, this is the monomer
  that is used to build up DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1006000'>This guy here is called
  a nucleoside, note the S.</span> </p><p><span m='1018000'>This guy here with the
  triphosphate on it is called a nucleotide.</span> </p><p><span m='1022000'>It's
  not usually written with such a big capital letter,</span> <span m='1027000'>but
  nonetheless I point this out. And, obviously, what is this</span> <span m='1032000'>triphosphate
  going to do for us? It's going to provide the energy to</span> <span m='1037000'>allow
  us to make DNA polymer chains. We're going to do a dehydration</span> <span m='1042000'>synthesis
  where we break two of those phosphates off and use it for</span> <span m='1047000'>the
  energy to be able to catalyze DNA chains to be made.</span> </p><p><span m='1052000'>OK.
  Now, when you combine nucleotides into a DNA strand you do</span> <span m='1060000'>so
  to create a sugar phosphate backbone. And you'll see for many</span> <span m='1068000'>molecules,
  I don't care that you know their structures</span> <span m='1076000'>terribly well.
  But for the basic structure of DNA,</span> <span m='1084000'>including its sugar
  phosphate backbone, it's going to be important</span> <span m='1092000'>for all
  that we talk about. So, what happens is we have a chain</span> <span m='1101000'>of
  DNA growing like this, and we have our OH here.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>We
  have our base here. And which carbon is this?</span> </p><p><span m='1116000'>Five
  prime, that's right. OK. Which carbon is this? This one.</span> </p><p><span m='1123000'>Great.
  That's the three prime, two prime, one prime.</span> </p><p><span m='1129000'>Great.
  OK. To this three prime carbon we add this triphosphate</span> <span m='1136000'>breaking
  off two phosphates there. The diphosphate gets broken off,</span> <span m='1145000'>the
  pyrophosphate. And we get a single phosphate linkage to the next</span> <span m='1157000'>subunit
  of the chain. So, here we go phosphate,</span> <span m='1169000'>sugar, phosphate,
  sugar. And if we ignore these bases,</span> <span m='1177000'>which, you know, who
  cares about the bases anyway, what we have is just</span> <span m='1181000'>phosphate,
  sugar, phosphate, sugar, phosphate,</span> <span m='1185000'>sugar, phosphate, sugar.
  OK? So, it's a very simple structure.</span> </p><p><span m='1190000'>There's nothing
  hard to remember about this. And the phosphate is</span> <span m='1194000'>always
  attached to the three prime carbon of the preceding sugar and to</span> <span m='1198000'>the
  five prime carbon of the next sugar.</span> </p><p><span m='1203000'>OK? So, we
  often speak of chains of DNA growing from the five prime end</span> <span m='1206000'>to
  the three prime end. And that confuses non-molecular</span> <span m='1210000'>biologists
  to no end. What are we talking about,</span> <span m='1213000'>five prime ends and
  three prime ends? This is what we're talking about.</span> </p><p><span m='1217000'>But
  the additions are catalyzed onto the three prime carbon of that</span> <span m='1220000'>sugar.
  It grows at it three prime end. So, you have sugar,</span> <span m='1224000'>phosphate,
  sugar, phosphate, sugar, phosphate. So, that's it.</span> </p><p><span m='1228000'>We're
  all done. Well, there are the bases,</span> <span m='1233000'>I guess, too, right?
  So, we'll mention these bases.</span> </p><p><span m='1241000'>The bases are, they
  come in two types. There are purines.</span> </p><p><span m='1248000'>Adenine and
  guanine are purines. And there's a six member rings with</span> <span m='1256000'>a
  five member ring. And there are two bases that are</span> <span m='1262000'>called
  pyrimidines, they are smaller, the thymine and</span> <span m='1267000'>the cytosine.
  And there are six member rings. And they have some</span> <span m='1272000'>carbon,
  some nitrogen, some oxygen and some hydrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='1277000'>But,
  you've got to admit that compared to proteins,</span> <span m='1282000'>this is
  pretty boring. It's just one long sugar phosphate</span> <span m='1287000'>chain.
  And two purines,</span> <span m='1291000'>slightly bigger things, two pyrimidines,
  slightly smaller</span> <span m='1294000'>things. Very similar structures for these
  two. I haven't even bothered</span> <span m='1298000'>to focus on the difference.
  And as compared to the richness of</span> <span m='1301000'>proteins, there's just
  no way anything interesting could happen</span> <span m='1304000'>with this. That
  was certainly the thinking at the time.</span> </p><p><span m='1308000'>You have
  to understand how important prior ideas,</span> <span m='1311000'>prior prejudice
  is to science. People look at it and say this must</span> <span m='1314000'>be some
  structural molecule. It is scaffolding.</span> </p><p><span m='1318000'>It's like
  the studs in the wall of the house you're building or</span> <span m='1322000'>something
  like that. Not too interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1327000'>So, what happens?
  Well, you know, it takes time to sort</span> <span m='1332000'>things out. People
  come back to this problem. Any thoughts?</span> </p><p><span m='1337000'>I mean
  I've given you one reason why this did not make a huge impact,</span> <span m='1342000'>because
  it was, you know, DNA was kind of a boring molecule and people</span> <span m='1347000'>weren't
  really sure this was right. It could be an artifact,</span> <span m='1352000'>right?
  Maybe some important protein had come along for the ride with the</span> <span m='1358000'>DNA
  faction, right? What's another reason why people</span> <span m='1363000'>might
  not have paid tremendous attention to this result?</span> </p><p><span m='1369000'>Sorry?
  It was just bacteria. Anything else? Couldn't imagine,</span> <span m='1374000'>right,
  how this DNA could encode the enzyme. Anything else? Date.</span> </p><p><span m='1380000'>It's
  in the middle of the Second World War. Maybe people had more</span> <span m='1384000'>important
  things to do, right? So, this is right in the</span> <span m='1388000'>middle of
  the Second World War, too. It's just worth noting that</span> <span m='1392000'>these
  guys are working in the middle of New York City at the Rockefeller</span> <span
  m='1396000'>Institute and it's in the middle of the Second World War.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1400000'>Anyway, war is over and some work continues on this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1404000'>And the work takes a somewhat different attack.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1408000'>Instead of working bacteria it now is, there's work here on certain</span>
  <span m='1412000'>bacterial viruses. So, instead, see,</span> <span m='1416000'>bacteria
  get their own here. Instead of using bacteria to infect</span> <span m='1422000'>mice,
  Hershey and Chase, and others at the time, used viruses</span> <span m='1427000'>to
  infect bacteria. So, here the bacterium is the</span> <span m='1433000'>victim.
  And people had found and had studied these amazingly</span> <span m='1438000'>interesting
  really tiny things that could affect a bacterium</span> <span m='1444000'>and kill
  it. These particles that had these funny</span> <span m='1449000'>shapes were called
  bacteriophage. What does phage mean? To eat.</span> </p><p><span m='1453000'>Bacteria
  eaters. Bacteriophages were these little</span> <span m='1458000'>viruses. They
  were incredibly tiny. You could filter them through very</span> <span m='1462000'>small
  filters. And, yet, when you added them to</span> <span m='1467000'>bacteria they
  would kill the bacteria.</span> </p><p><span m='1472000'>These were very simple
  things. I'm reluctant to call them</span> <span m='1475000'>creatures. Are they
  alive? This is a favorite question people</span> <span m='1478000'>would like to
  debate. They say are viruses alive?</span> </p><p><span m='1482000'>And the answer
  is who cares? I mean it depends on what you want</span> <span m='1485000'>to define
  alive to mean. To me it's not alive in that it</span> <span m='1489000'>cannot replicate
  on its own without a host, so I won't call it alive.</span> </p><p><span m='1492000'>But,
  anyway, I'll refer to them loosely as these creatures that eat</span> <span m='1496000'>bacteria.
  They were very simple. And all they really had in them was</span> <span m='1499000'>some
  DNA in their capsid, this capsid up here, and some</span> <span m='1503000'>protein.
  But they could attach to a bacterium</span> <span m='1508000'>and after a certain
  amount of time cause the bacteria to burst open and</span> <span m='1515000'>produce
  lots of daughter-phage, lots of daughter bacteriophage. It</span> <span m='1522000'>could
  replicate within this bacteria.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>So, somehow this,
  while I might not want to call it</span> <span m='1533000'>alive, certainly can
  reproduce itself, or at least with the help of</span> <span m='1537000'>a bacterium
  can reproduce itself. When people first discovered this</span> <span m='1541000'>bacteriophage,
  what do you think they wanted to do</span> <span m='1545000'>with them? Sorry? Yeah.
  Where? In humans.</span> </p><p><span m='1548000'>The first thought about what to
  do with bacteriophage were a whole</span> <span m='1552000'>bunch of interesting
  Russians who wanted to make up large quantities</span> <span m='1556000'>of bacteriophage
  and have people drink them.</span> </p><p><span m='1560000'>So, they would kill
  all their bacteria. And this was the early</span> <span m='1562000'>ideas for antibiotics.
  It didn't quite pan out that way.</span> </p><p><span m='1565000'>But, you know,
  people have all these very exciting ideas of,</span> <span m='1568000'>wow, I've
  got something to kill bacteria, let's pour it down a</span> <span m='1571000'>patient
  and see if that does something good for them.</span> </p><p><span m='1574000'>You
  know, that's why there are institutional review boards,</span> <span m='1577000'>too,
  to make sure that you can't just do that right off the bat.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1580000'>Somebody else has got to think about it also.</span> </p><p><span m='1583000'>It
  turns out not to be a great way to kill patients, to kill</span> <span m='1586000'>bacteria,
  sorry. No, it doesn't actually kill</span> <span m='1590000'>patients, but it doesn't
  also kill the bacteria so well in human beings.</span> </p><p><span m='1594000'>So,
  anyway. So, the question was how is it that</span> <span m='1598000'>these viruses
  kill the bacteria? Somehow they inject something into</span> <span m='1602000'>the
  bacteria, something causes something to happen,</span> <span m='1607000'>which causes
  virus particles to be made. I don't put too fine a point</span> <span m='1611000'>on
  it because that's all you could really say at that point,</span> <span m='1615000'>something
  goes in and something comes out.</span> </p><p><span m='1620000'>So, what goes in?
  How could we tell what goes in?</span> </p><p><span m='1625000'>Yup. By seeing what's
  left out. How could we see what's left out?</span> </p><p><span m='1630000'>Just
  being really practical, how are we going to tell?</span> </p><p><span m='1635000'>Visually
  look, but that turns out to be terribly hard thing to do.</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>You've
  got to have really good eyes to be able to say the protein is</span> <span m='1645000'>still
  there but not the DNA, or the DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1650000'>Because the thought
  was if this thing is injecting its DNA then the</span> <span m='1653000'>DNA must
  be carrying the instructions to make phage,</span> <span m='1657000'>and this would
  be hereditary material. So,</span> <span m='1660000'>what we want to show is that
  the protein stays out and the DNA goes</span> <span m='1664000'>in. But how is that
  going to, how do you do that practically?</span> </p><p><span m='1667000'>Radioactive
  labeling turns out to be the best way to do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1671000'>If
  we could label radioactively the DNA with one label and the protein</span> <span
  m='1674000'>with a different label, we could see which radioactive</span> <span
  m='1678000'>isotope goes into the bacteria. Any candidates for an element that</span>
  <span m='1682000'>we could use to label DNA that won't be in protein?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1686000'>Sorry? I'm sorry? Oh, who had one? Uranium.</span> </p><p><span m='1690000'>Somebody's
  thinking World War II here, right, there would be some</span> <span m='1694000'>spare
  uranium around. The problem with that is that DNA</span> <span m='1699000'>does
  not actually have uranium in it, and so when you put uranium in it</span> <span
  m='1703000'>wouldn't still be DNA. We would like to label it with an</span> <span
  m='1707000'>element that's actually in DNA. So the only difference is that it's</span>
  <span m='1711000'>a radioisotope. Phosphorus. Phosphorus.</span> </p><p><span m='1715000'>Well,
  there's obviously phosphorus in that sugar phosphate backbone.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1719000'>Is there phosphorus in a typical amino acid? Any of the 20 amino</span>
  <span m='1723000'>acids? No phosphorus. Great. So, we could use a</span> <span m='1726000'>phosphorus
  isotope. We could P32 label the DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1730000'>But how do
  make live bacteriophages that are labeled with radioactive</span> <span m='1734000'>phosphorus?
  I mean what kind of fancy chemistry do you</span> <span m='1738000'>need to do that?
  Yes? Perfect if you grow the</span> <span m='1742000'>bacteria in radioactively,
  in medium. If you grow the virus</span> <span m='1746000'>and the bacteria in medium
  that has radioactive phosphate,</span> <span m='1750000'>the bacteria and the virus
  take care of it for you.</span> </p><p><span m='1754000'>The phosphate is automatically
  incorporated. So,</span> <span m='1758000'>you don't have to do any chemistry. You
  just feed phosphate,</span> <span m='1762000'>radioactive phosphate into the medium.
  And the phage that are</span> <span m='1766000'>produced will be radioactively labeled.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1770000'>Purify them and use them in your experiment. Similarly,</span>
  <span m='1774000'>what are we going to label our proteins with?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1779000'>Carbon? No. Hydrogen? No. Oxygen? Nitrogen? No,</span> <span m='1783000'>because
  the bases have nitrogen. Sulfa. We've only got sulfa.</span> </p><p><span m='1788000'>Where
  is sulfa going to be? So, for example, cysteines with</span> <span m='1793000'>thiamines,
  right, we've got sulfa. Here's S35.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>So, we can take
  bacteria and we could, we can take phage,</span> <span m='1803000'>and by growing
  them in the presence of radioactive DNA,</span> <span m='1808000'>no, radioactive
  phosphorus, P32 and growing them in the presence</span> <span m='1813000'>of radioactive
  sulfa, S35, we are about to produce</span> <span m='1819000'>bacteriophage that
  are labeled. OK? So, P32, S35. Now we infect</span> <span m='1824000'>bacteria with
  them. Let me take a big tube here.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>I'm going to
  add bacteria. I've got the phage here. The phage</span> <span m='1833000'>particles
  are attached to the bacteria and they are going to</span> <span m='1837000'>inject
  whatever they inject. Now what do we have to do? We've</span> <span m='1841000'>got
  to knock off the bacteriophage particles from the bacteria.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1845000'>I want to knock them off and see what is staying with the viral</span>
  <span m='1848000'>particles and what goes into the bacteria. So,</span> <span m='1852000'>how
  do I get in there with tweezers and separate off,</span> <span m='1856000'>peel
  off each virus from the bacteria?</span> </p><p><span m='1860000'>Washing turns
  out not to be strong enough. You've got to previal to</span> <span m='1864000'>get
  these things off, so you really need some incredibly</span> <span m='1869000'>strong
  agitation. So, specialized devices were used</span> <span m='1873000'>to create
  intense agitation. What specialized devices you're</span> <span m='1878000'>aware
  of that do that? Blenders. Kitchen blenders.</span> </p><p><span m='1883000'>The
  Waring blender turns out to be the perfect laboratory device for</span> <span m='1887000'>this
  experiment. And this is actually known as the</span> <span m='1892000'>Waring Blender
  Experiment. You take the bacteria with the</span> <span m='1896000'>phage attached
  to it, you let them attach and do whatever</span> <span m='1900000'>they're going
  to do, inject their DNA, as we know turns</span> <span m='1904000'>out is the right
  answer. And then you press puree and then</span> <span m='1908000'>vrrrr, and the
  viral particles fall off. So, it's important to know how</span> <span m='1912000'>things
  really happen. So then what happens is the</span> <span m='1916000'>bacteria are
  separated from these particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1920000'>And it turns out
  these particles are, the viral particles are much lighter,</span> <span m='1924000'>much
  less dense than the bacteria. So, how do we separate them?</span> </p><p><span m='1928000'>Centrifuge
  them. We centrifuge them.</span> </p><p><span m='1933000'>The bacterial particles
  are there up in the supernatant turn out to be</span> <span m='1937000'>our phage
  capsids. And now what do we do?</span> </p><p><span m='1941000'>We take this stuff,
  we measure the radioactivity in the supernatant,</span> <span m='1946000'>that is
  the material that stays above, and we measure the</span> <span m='1950000'>radioactivity
  in the pellet. And what do we end up seeing?</span> </p><p><span m='1956000'>Where
  does most of the P32, what shows up in the pellet?</span> </p><p><span m='1963000'>Mostly
  P32 shows up in the pellet. Is there no S35 in the pellet? You</span> <span m='1969000'>know,
  in the textbook story, of course, there's no S35 because</span> <span m='1976000'>they
  want it to be nice and clean. But in reality there's going to be</span> <span m='1982000'>some
  S35. But it was, you know, less than 1% of the S35</span> <span m='1986000'>ends
  up in the pellet. Most of the S35 stays up here in</span> <span m='1991000'>the
  supernatant. Does all of the phosphorus go in?</span> </p><p><span m='1996000'>No,
  of course not. Some of the viruses didn't even attach and not</span> <span m='2000000'>everything
  goes in. So, there's still radioactive</span> <span m='2005000'>phosphate up in
  the supernatant. But the striking this is that the</span> <span m='2011000'>pellet
  primarily has gotten the radioactive phosphorus,</span> <span m='2018000'>not the
  radioactive sulfa, and therefore we can conclude that</span> <span m='2025000'>what?
  Well, more DNA went in than protein. Are we therefore entitled</span> <span m='2032000'>to
  include that DNA is the hereditary material? Why?</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Well,
  I mean suppose that 1% sulfate is tracking one minor protein that</span> <span m='2043000'>is
  the secret. You can't, it's very hard to rule</span> <span m='2047000'>out that
  there's no contaminants traveling along with the DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2051000'>And
  if you really truly disbelieve DNA, you could be churlish and say,</span> <span
  m='2055000'>well, I just don't believe that you've so purified it that you can</span>
  <span m='2058000'>completely rule out that some minor protein component is really</span>
  <span m='2062000'>conferring heredity. In fact, when you really look</span> <span
  m='2066000'>closely, Avery, McCarty and McLeod's biochemistry,</span> <span m='2070000'>I
  believe, was purer than the purity of this experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='2074000'>But
  by this point thinking had begun to shift toward DNA being a</span> <span m='2078000'>reasonable
  hereditary molecule. In addition, it was the second line</span> <span m='2082000'>of
  proof, different from the pneumococcus, using a different</span> <span m='2086000'>system,
  both pointing to the same answer. And the intellectual tide</span> <span m='2090000'>shifted
  to recognizing that this probably was right,</span> <span m='2094000'>and the reason
  these experiments were pointing to DNA was DNA had to</span> <span m='2098000'>be
  the right answer. But, of course,</span> <span m='2102000'>how was it the right
  answer? What was it about DNA that could</span> <span m='2108000'>confer these properties?
  This was still unclear in 1953,</span> <span m='2113000'>but not for that long.
  It became clarified relatively soon thereafter.</span> </p><p><span m='2119000'>And,
  of course, it became clarified with the</span> <span m='2124000'>understanding of
  DNA structure, the double helix.</span> </p><p><span m='2130000'>Nobody here has
  not heard of the double helix. Probably there's</span> <span m='2134000'>nobody,
  no grownup who doesn't know about the double helix and all that,</span> <span m='2138000'>but
  nonetheless I want to stop and think a little bit also,</span> <span m='2142000'>I'll
  say on a personal note, this is the first year I've taught</span> <span m='2147000'>this
  class after, the first time I've taught this</span> <span m='2151000'>class when
  Crick and Watson have not both been alive.</span> </p><p><span m='2155000'>Some
  of you may know that Frances Crick dies just this past summer.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2160000'>Which was very sad. He was an incredible person and,</span> <span m='2163000'>you
  know, as I've said, Mendel was one of my heroes.</span> </p><p><span m='2166000'>Francis
  Crick was also one of my heroes. He was just an</span> <span m='2169000'>extraordinary
  person. But Jim Watson is still alive and</span> <span m='2172000'>kicking and still
  quite active. And so, in any case, you're not far</span> <span m='2175000'>removed.
  So, I tell you a little bit about this stuff as history,</span> <span m='2178000'>but
  this history I'm telling you about, these people are,</span> <span m='2181000'>for
  the most part, Francis' passing notwithstanding,</span> <span m='2184000'>alive
  and kicking. Jim Watson is still quite alive.</span> </p><p><span m='2187000'>Actually,
  McCarty is still alive. It's really, anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='2190000'>So,
  1953, just a year later, Jim Watson and Francis Crick are</span> <span m='2196000'>working
  in England. Watson is a student for Indiana,</span> <span m='2202000'>a former ornithologist,
  had his interest in ornithology originally,</span> <span m='2208000'>and then studies
  more biology and came to England because he wanted to</span> <span m='2214000'>study
  the gene. Francis Crick,</span> <span m='2220000'>a physicist who worked in the
  admiralty during World War II.</span> </p><p><span m='2225000'>And, of course, what
  they did was on the basis of an awful lot of</span> <span m='2231000'>modeling and
  getting to see experimental x-ray diffraction</span> <span m='2236000'>pictures
  of Roselyn Franklin from London who made a model.</span> </p><p><span m='2241000'>And
  the model is this beautiful, and I haven't drawn it to its proper</span> <span m='2246000'>proportions,
  but this beautiful double helical structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2252000'>Five
  prime, one chain of DNA running in one direction,</span> <span m='2257000'>five
  prime to three prime. An anti-parallel chain of DNA going</span> <span m='2262000'>in
  this direction, five prime to three prime.</span> </p><p><span m='2267000'>It was
  a beautiful structure. Jim Watson has written a whole book</span> <span m='2272000'>about
  the discovery of the double helix structure,</span> <span m='2277000'>and we are
  only 51 years past that. It was, anybody who hasn't read The</span> <span m='2282000'>Double
  Helix, this book, really should. It's one of the</span> <span m='2286000'>treat
  books of science literature, and actually is on many people's</span> <span m='2290000'>lists
  of some of the great books of the 20th century.</span> </p><p><span m='2295000'>It's
  a wonderful competitive story of Crick and Watson racing against</span> <span m='2299000'>Linus
  Pauling. It's, you know,</span> <span m='2303000'>someone came along and had lunch
  in Cambridge with Crick and Watson.</span> </p><p><span m='2308000'>And they came
  away and said, this was before they discovered the</span> <span m='2311000'>structure,
  about a year or so before, and said these guys are idiots.</span> </p><p><span m='2314000'>They
  can't even memorize the structure of A and T and C and G,</span> <span m='2318000'>and
  they're trying to find, you know, the structure of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='2321000'>These
  guys are never going to get anywhere. So,</span> <span m='2324000'>this person,
  who we'll come back to in a moment, was wrong about this</span> <span m='2328000'>particular
  point. Because what Crick and Watson did</span> <span m='2331000'>was they played
  around with the models, and what they ended up</span> <span m='2334000'>noticing
  was a couple of things. First off, from Rosalyn Franklin's</span> <span m='2338000'>pictures,
  that this was helical. The x-ray to fraction pictures could</span> <span m='2341000'>tell
  you at a glance that the structure was helical.</span> </p><p><span m='2345000'>They
  saw that. They then tried to make helices. Now,</span> <span m='2349000'>other people,
  Linus Pauling knew something that DNA probably had to</span> <span m='2352000'>be
  helical, and somehow he just got it totally wrong.</span> </p><p><span m='2356000'>He
  made just a nutty model of DNA. Linus Pauling, the smartest chemist</span> <span
  m='2359000'>of the century made a crazy model of DNA where he took the sugar</span>
  <span m='2363000'>phosphate backbones and put all the sugar phosphate backbones
  in the</span> <span m='2367000'>middle, and had three of them. He had a triple helical
  model with</span> <span m='2370000'>sugar phosphates in the middle. And what can
  you tell me about the</span> <span m='2374000'>charge on these sugar phosphate backbones?
  Very negative.</span> </p><p><span m='2378000'>You're going to stick a whole bunch
  of negative charges near each other</span> <span m='2382000'>in the middle? No way.
  Anybody could have known.</span> </p><p><span m='2386000'>This was a bush-league
  mistake, so Crick and Watson said phew,</span> <span m='2390000'>Pauling has got
  it wrong. They put together this model.</span> </p><p><span m='2394000'>And the
  key to the model was the recognition of base pairing,</span> <span m='2398000'>the
  recognition of base paring. That if I take a thiamine here and I</span> <span m='2415000'>take
  an adenine here. That these two groups would be</span> <span m='2436000'>pointing
  at each other in such a way as to make two hydrogen bonds with a</span> <span m='2448000'>certain
  characteristic distance. And, not just that, but cytosine</span> <span m='2461000'>and
  guanine could also be fit into that same distance.</span> </p><p><span m='2474000'>And
  they would have three hydrogen bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='2490000'>And here NH,
  H, doo, doo, doo, doo,</span> <span m='2500000'>doo, doo, doo, three hydrogen bonds.
  And they would fit the, what do I</span> <span m='2510000'>got? Oops. Thank you.
  Good point.</span> </p><p><span m='2520000'>That's the problem. Yup. Well, it's
  a little messy but</span> <span m='2526000'>anyway. The business end here is three
  hydrogen bonds and two</span> <span m='2533000'>hydrogen bonds, and they both fit
  into the same</span> <span m='2539000'>distance perfectly. So, this double helix
  here could</span> <span m='2546000'>have either As and Ts or Gs and Cs or Cs and
  Gs or Ts and As.</span> </p><p><span m='2553000'>And they would all fit perfectly
  with each other.</span> </p><p><span m='2557000'>Now, there was an old observation,
  not that old, there was an</span> <span m='2562000'>observation floating around
  at the time that said when you analyze the</span> <span m='2566000'>amount of As
  and Ts in DNA, you always found out that the amount</span> <span m='2571000'>of
  A tended to be very close to the amount of T. The amount of C tended</span> <span
  m='2575000'>to be very close to the amount of G.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>Although,
  these amounts could be different. This was due to a</span> <span m='2586000'>biochemist
  called Chargaff. And they're called, this was called</span> <span m='2592000'>Chargaff's
  Rule or Chargaff's Law or Chargaff's Observation.</span> </p><p><span m='2598000'>Chargaff
  noted that the percentage of these amounts tended to be equal</span> <span m='2604000'>but
  didn't know what to make of it. This perfectly explained that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2610000'>It was very good. Remember I said somebody came</span> <span m='2613000'>through
  Cambridge and said these guys were turkeys,</span> <span m='2616000'>Crick and Watson
  were turkeys because they couldn't even remember</span> <span m='2619000'>the structure
  and all that? This was a very distinguished</span> <span m='2623000'>chemist who
  said this about Crick and Watson. It was Chargaff.</span> </p><p><span m='2626000'>Chargaff
  came through and said these guys are turkeys.</span> </p><p><span m='2629000'>But
  it was Chargaff's Rule that Chargaff had missed the importance</span> <span m='2633000'>of.
  He was quite bitter about this through much of his life.</span> </p><p><span m='2636000'>And
  there's a very wonderful biting quote that Chargaff says when Crick</span> <span
  m='2639000'>and Watson become famous for the DNA double helix.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2643000'>Let's see if I can get it right. He says that such pigmies should</span>
  <span m='2649000'>cast such giant shadows, referring to Crick and Watson,</span>
  <span m='2655000'>that such pigmies should cast such giant shadows only shows how
  late in</span> <span m='2661000'>the day it is. Anyway, he was not happy.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2667000'>So, all right. Now, this was a big deal thing.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2671000'>Crick and Watson knew this was very important. They raced to publish
  a</span> <span m='2674000'>paper about this. They sent it off to Nature.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2677000'>It's a gem of a paper. It's a page roughly in text.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2681000'>It's very short, very clear, has this beautiful</span>
  <span m='2684000'>picture drawn from Francis Crick's wife, Odile. And it is just
  a</span> <span m='2687000'>charming paper. They know that they've cracked the</span>
  <span m='2690000'>secret of life. Why do they know they've cracked</span> <span
  m='2693000'>the secret of life? Because the most important thing</span> <span m='2696000'>about
  this model here is not its structure per se.</span> </p><p><span m='2700000'>But
  that it explains how it is that a DNA molecule can be replicated,</span> <span m='2704000'>that
  somehow all it takes is for those two strands to come apart,</span> <span m='2709000'>who
  knows how, and that when they come apart each can serve as a</span> <span m='2713000'>template
  for the other because since As always match Ts and Cs always</span> <span m='2718000'>match
  Gs, each strand has enough information for the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2722000'>That's
  how replication happens. You have two strands, each of which</span> <span m='2727000'>has
  sufficient information to encode the other.</span> </p><p><span m='2732000'>They
  somehow come apart. They each serve as a template for</span> <span m='2735000'>the
  other. And that's that. That is the secret of life, how</span> <span m='2738000'>life
  replicates itself. Not just that. We've explained</span> <span m='2741000'>replication.
  What about mutation. What's mutation? It sometimes gets</span> <span m='2745000'>it
  wrong. It sometimes screws up. So, for one little biochemical</span> <span m='2748000'>model
  we've explained replication and mutation. That's pretty good.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2751000'>Now, the thing is, in writing this paper and getting this off to the</span>
  <span m='2754000'>Journal, this was not an easy thing to get done quickly.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2758000'>You couldn't, you just didn't have time to explain all
  these details.</span> </p><p><span m='2761000'>They wanted to stake their claim
  about this, so they wrote up the</span> <span m='2765000'>structure. And instead
  of going through a long about how this</span> <span m='2769000'>explains replication
  and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah,</span> <span m='2773000'>there's one
  sentence in the paper, the last sentence of the paper in</span> <span m='2776000'>which
  they just say it has not escaped our notice that this model</span> <span m='2780000'>explains
  replication and everything else. Basically the last sentence</span> <span m='2784000'>says,
  oh, and by the way, it has not escaped our notice that</span> <span m='2788000'>this
  explains the secret of life. Although, it didn't say it like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2791000'>It's the coyest sentence in the scientific literature.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2795000'>It's really just an amazing sentence there.</span> </p><p><span m='2798000'>And
  then they come back a couple minutes later and write a paper</span> <span m='2802000'>explaining
  what they mean and all that, but it's just a great sentence.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2805000'>So, you will hear molecular biologists make reference,</span> <span
  m='2809000'>use in their speech the phrase, it has not escaped our notice that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2812000'>And it's always a homage back to this particular sentence
  in this</span> <span m='2816000'>paper of Crick and Watson. OK, now, last thing.
  Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2819000'>Jim Watson was 25 and Francis was 35 when he
  did this.</span> </p><p><span m='2823000'>Yes. He was a 25-year-old kid when he
  did this. That's right.</span> </p><p><span m='2829000'>Pretty amazing stuff. So,
  last point I want to touch on,</span> <span m='2836000'>and I'm not sure I'll get
  to, get all the way there, but this</span> <span m='2843000'>model, this model here
  of DNA coming apart and each strand serving as a</span> <span m='2849000'>template
  for the other strand is called Semi-Conservative</span> <span m='2856000'>Replication.
  That is one strand is used as the</span> <span m='2863000'>template for the other
  strand, so there's an old strand and a new</span> <span m='2870000'>strand that's
  made. In theory, you could imagine that</span> <span m='2877000'>DNA replication
  occurred not like this.</span> </p><p><span m='2885000'>But instead somehow, I can't
  imagine how, but you could</span> <span m='2889000'>imagine, and people were willing
  to imagine it, that the old strands</span> <span m='2894000'>stayed together but
  somehow became a template for making a new double</span> <span m='2898000'>helix
  without actually using them. This model of the strands actually</span> <span m='2903000'>serving
  as a template would predict that each new DNA double helix was,</span> <span m='2907000'>in
  fact, composed of one old and one new strand.</span> </p><p><span m='2912000'>If
  you could prove that then you'd have real confirmation of this Crick</span> <span
  m='2916000'>Watson model, semi-conservative replication. And so,</span> <span m='2920000'>a
  young student, two young students, Matt Meselson, who's still working</span> <span
  m='2924000'>and is down the road at Harvard and a wonderful person,</span> <span
  m='2928000'>and Frank Stahl, who's still working in Oregon, proved that the new
  DNAs</span> <span m='2932000'>that were made after each generation were, in fact,</span>
  <span m='2936000'>composed of one old strand and one new strand.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2940000'>How could you possibly do that? Sorry? Radioactive labeling. But</span>
  <span m='2946000'>how do you radioactively label it so that you can see that it's,</span>
  <span m='2952000'>that you've got a double helix that's half one and half the other?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2958000'>Old ones labeled with, well, with one isotope. It actually
  turns out</span> <span m='2964000'>to be nitrogen. The new one with a new isotope.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2970000'>Say N14. You can do heavy nitrogen and ordinary nitrogen.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2974000'>And if what you could do is grow up your DNA, when you
  first grow it in</span> <span m='2978000'>normal nitrogen, then you shift to N15,</span>
  <span m='2982000'>heavy nitrogen, you could make DNA molecules that were half old,</span>
  <span m='2986000'>half new, and therefore half labeled with normal nitrogen,</span>
  <span m='2990000'>half labeled with heavy nitrogen. And how would I prove that these</span>
  <span m='2994000'>DNA molecules were a 50/50 hybrid? What would be the property
  that I</span> <span m='2998000'>would be able to test? Well, radioactivity turns
  out to be</span> <span m='3002000'>really hard to weight density. It turns out density,
  if I could</span> <span m='3006000'>just measure the density of the DNA, I would
  show that if the</span> <span m='3010000'>semi-conservative model is true, the molecules
  will now have</span> <span m='3014000'>intermediate density between all heavy and
  all light nitrogen.</span> </p><p><span m='3019000'>They had to work out a centrifugation
  technique so</span> <span m='3023000'>sensitive, a salt gradient centrifugation
  where you could put</span> <span m='3027000'>DNA on it. You had a really fine salt
  gradient spun in a centrifuge.</span> </p><p><span m='3032000'>And depending on
  where the DNA migrated, you could measure the</span> <span m='3035000'>density of
  the DNA. And they were able to show that,</span> <span m='3038000'>in fact, newly
  replicated DNA strands had this intermediate</span> <span m='3041000'>density that
  would be expected from the semi-conservative model.</span> </p><p><span m='3045000'>And
  so, in fact, by that point the semi-conservative model,</span> <span m='3048000'>I
  think, is well established. In some sense you would say the</span> <span m='3051000'>beauty
  of the double helix was almost one of these very rare</span> <span m='3055000'>scientific
  results where when you look at it you say it can't</span> <span m='3058000'>possibly
  be wrong. It explains too much.</span> </p><p><span m='3062000'>It's too beautiful.
  But, as we've discussed before, that's</span> <span m='3066000'>not enough. You
  need some proofs that it's real.</span> </p><p><span m='3071000'>And this Meselson-Stahl
  experiment provided a real confirmation of that.</span> </p><p><span m='3075000'>Onto
  next time.</span> </p>
