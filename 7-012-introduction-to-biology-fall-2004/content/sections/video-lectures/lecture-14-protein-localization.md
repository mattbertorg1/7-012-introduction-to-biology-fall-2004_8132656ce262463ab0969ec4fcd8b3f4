title: 'Lecture 14: Protein Localization'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning. Good morning. Today I'm going to talk
  about,</span> <span m='4000'>this is lecture 14, and I'm going to talk about protein
  localization.</span> </p><p><span m='8000'>Now, some of you may remember that earlier
  in the semester I was</span> <span m='12000'>walking around with this sling. And
  so to help me from writing on</span> <span m='16000'>the board, even though it is
  this arm, I have made a PowerPoint</span> <span m='20000'>presentation of most of
  the things that I would have written</span> <span m='24000'>on the board. And for
  your ease and comfort,</span> <span m='29000'>this PowerPoint presentation will
  be posted online so you won't have to</span> <span m='33000'>write down everything
  in my slides. So just sort of sit back. And I</span> <span m='38000'>will write
  a few things on the board, so you can write those down.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>OK.
  So now you guys have heard about central dogma from Professor</span> <span m='46000'>Eric
  Lander and you've heard about gene regulation last Friday.</span> </p><p><span m='51000'>Here
  is something that you're familiar with,</span> <span m='55000'>this image here depicting
  central dogma.</span> </p><p><span m='60000'>DNA replicates to DNA. This is replication.
  Replication.</span> </p><p><span m='66000'>DNA is translated, excuse me, transcribed
  to RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='73000'>Transcription. And RNA is translated to protein.</span>
  </p><p><span m='79000'>Central dogma. Where does this occur? Where does replication</span>
  <span m='86000'>occur in a cell? Nucleus. Good.</span> </p><p><span m='93000'>Where
  does transcription occur in a cell? Nucleus.</span> </p><p><span m='99000'>I heard
  nucleus. That is correct. And where does</span> <span m='106000'>translation occur?
  Cytoplasm. Ah, and yet we know</span> <span m='113000'>that these processes require
  proteins to do them.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>OK. You've just described where
  these processes occur in a</span> <span m='128000'>eukaryotic cell. Let's say you're
  a bacterium.</span> </p><p><span m='136000'>In bacteria, where does replication,
  transcription and translation occur?</span> </p><p><span m='144000'>Where? Cytoplasm.
  OK. So now we've made bacteria look very</span> <span m='151000'>simple. But they're
  not that simple. And so let's take a look here.</span> </p><p><span m='156000'>Here's
  a bacterial cell. I've drawn what could be E.</span> </p><p><span m='161000'>coli.
  I has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and the space in</span> <span m='166000'>between
  is the perisplasm. Now, here is its circular</span> <span m='171000'>chromosome.
  I've transcribed some gene to an RNA and a ribosomal pop</span> <span m='176000'>on
  and make a protein which his in the cytoplasm.</span> </p><p><span m='181000'>Yet
  some proteins are localized to the inner membrane,</span> <span m='185000'>others
  are localized to the periplasm, and some are localized to</span> <span m='189000'>the
  outer membrane, and others are actually exported</span> <span m='194000'>completely
  outside the cell. Even more complicated is a</span> <span m='198000'>eukaryotic
  protein, because not only does it have a</span> <span m='203000'>plasma membrane
  where proteins are localized. It has a bunch</span> <span m='207000'>of organelles.
  There's the nucleus and there's</span> <span m='212000'>mitochondria and there's
  endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus.</span> </p><p><span m='217000'>And it,
  too, translates RNA by ribosomes in the cytoplasm.</span> </p><p><span m='222000'>So
  how do these proteins get back to the nucleus or go into the</span> <span m='227000'>mitochondria
  or get into the organelles? So what we're going to</span> <span m='232000'>do in
  the next few slides is we're going to follow the process,</span> <span m='237000'>because
  they're so similar in bacteria and eukaryotic cells,</span> <span m='242000'>of
  how proteins get to the membrane and how they get outside the cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='248000'>And then I'll go back and talk about how proteins get into some of the</span>
  <span m='251000'>organelles. So let me show you what some of the proteins are.</span>
  </p><p><span m='255000'>So an example of a cytoplasmic protein in bacteria is beta</span>
  <span m='259000'>galactosidase. You've heard about it.</span> </p><p><span m='263000'>It
  breaks down lactose. It's in the cytoplasm. And example</span> <span m='267000'>of
  a membrane protein is a lactose receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='271000'>The lacY
  permease that's on the surface of the cell brings lactose</span> <span m='275000'>in.
  An example of a fully secreted protein is a toxin.</span> </p><p><span m='279000'>For
  instance, bacillus anthracis makes anthrax toxin.</span> </p><p><span m='284000'>It's
  completely exported from the cell. In a eukaryotic cell there's</span> <span m='288000'>a
  bunch of cytoplasmic proteins. There are all of the glycolytic</span> <span m='293000'>enzymes.
  And, for instance, biosynthetic amino</span> <span m='297000'>acid enzymes like
  histidine synthesis enzymes, those</span> <span m='301000'>are cytoplasmic. For
  a membrane protein there are</span> <span m='306000'>receptors, like the receptor
  for insulin, a hormone,</span> <span m='311000'>a peptide hormone, or growth factor
  receptors, every receptor that's</span> <span m='315000'>membrane-bound. And a fully
  secreted protein.</span> </p><p><span m='320000'>Some cells like pancreatic cells
  secrete insulin.</span> </p><p><span m='325000'>Some cells like some of your immune
  cells secrete antibodies.</span> </p><p><span m='330000'>OK. So it was not clear
  how these cytoplasmically made proteins,</span> <span m='335000'>proteins that were
  made in the cytoplasm got to this location.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>And the
  person who worked on this was George Palade.</span> </p><p><span m='345000'>And
  this was in the fifties. And he studied pancreatic cells</span> <span m='350000'>because
  they're master secretors. And he was able to perfect his</span> <span m='355000'>microscopic
  technique. And you can see here this is a</span> <span m='360000'>pancreatic cell.
  This is endoplasmic reticulum</span> <span m='365000'>studded with ribosomes. These
  are mitochondria.</span> </p><p><span m='370000'>This is the nucleus. Here is another
  picture that he took.</span> </p><p><span m='375000'>And here is the rough endoplasmic
  reticulum studded with ribosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='379000'>Here's Golgi apparatus.
  And then there are like little vesicles.</span> </p><p><span m='384000'>So he did
  this experiment where he decided he would pulse label</span> <span m='389000'>proteins
  as they were being synthesized in a pancreas,</span> <span m='394000'>directly in
  a pancreas. So what he did was he injected</span> <span m='401000'>radioactive amino
  acids directly into the pancreas of hamsters.</span> </p><p><span m='411000'>I guess
  I could draw a little</span> <span m='420000'>hamster here. And he directly injected
  radioactive isotopes.</span> </p><p><span m='426000'>And what he's doing is these
  radioactive amino acids will be</span> <span m='432000'>incorporated into proteins
  as they're being translated,</span> <span m='439000'>and he can follow the population
  of freshly translated proteins through</span> <span m='445000'>the cell. So he injects
  hamsters with the radioactive amino acids.</span> </p><p><span m='452000'>And then
  at various time points he adds, he also injects glutaraldehyde.</span> </p><p><span
  m='458000'>So first the label, then glutaraldehyde. And what this</span> <span m='464000'>does
  is it fixes the cells in its tracks. Whatever the cell is doing</span> <span m='470000'>it
  just stops. And he removes the pancreas and he</span> <span m='476000'>looks at
  the cells. This is fixes the cells.</span> </p><p><span m='482000'>So, Tom, I don't
  know what's going on here. Can we not use this,</span> <span m='487000'>Tom? All
  right. It's just doing it on its own. It has some time thing?</span> </p><p><span
  m='493000'>Oh. All right. So what he found was at the early time points,</span>
  <span m='498000'>now, what I did, I did this, OK? He didn't see yellow. What I did</span>
  <span m='504000'>was I added yellow to his original slide to show you at the earliest</span>
  <span m='509000'>time point he found the label associated with the endoplasmic</span>
  <span m='515000'>reticulum. At the next time point he found the</span> <span m='520000'>label
  associated with the Golgi apparatus. And then at even later</span> <span m='524000'>time
  points he found the label in secretory vesicles.</span> </p><p><span m='528000'>So
  this is my representation of what he found.</span> </p><p><span m='532000'>So here's
  a cell, nucleus, mitochondria.</span> </p><p><span m='536000'>The early time points
  the label was in the ER followed by the Golgi.</span> </p><p><span m='540000'>I
  didn't do that. Yeah, take it out.</span> </p><p><span m='545000'>Followed by vesicles.
  It's not working. OK.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>Sorry for that. I'm sorry.
  So he won a Nobel Prize for this</span> <span m='555000'>work because it is the
  pathway that still holds true today.</span> </p><p><span m='561000'>Now, he won
  the Nobel Prize in '74. And at about that time, maybe '71,</span> <span m='566000'>another
  scientist names Cesar Milstein was working on immunology.</span> </p><p><span m='572000'>And
  what he did was he fused a cancer cell with a cell that</span> <span m='576000'>constantly
  secreted antibodies, so he ended up having an</span> <span m='580000'>immortalized
  antibody producing cell. And he was doing some research and</span> <span m='584000'>he
  did in vitro analysis. And he found that antibodies that</span> <span m='589000'>were
  produced in vitro were longer than the ones that were actually</span> <span m='593000'>coming
  out of the cell. So he proposed that there was an</span> <span m='597000'>N-terminal
  end. He looked and saw that the</span> <span m='602000'>N-terminus was different,
  and he proposed that it would</span> <span m='606000'>possibly be cleaved upon export.
  OK? And so this is, he won a Nobel</span> <span m='610000'>Prize, not for this work
  but for his work in immunology.</span> </p><p><span m='614000'>And this was also
  correct. And so this is from his lecture,</span> <span m='619000'>Nobel lecture.
  It says in vitro synthesis of immunoglobulin light</span> <span m='623000'>chains,
  that's what he was doing, to our delight we ran into the</span> <span m='627000'>unexpected
  observation of the existence of a biosynthetic</span> <span m='631000'>precursor
  of light chain. Further experiments led us to</span> <span m='636000'>propose the
  extra N-terminal sequence was a signal for vectorial</span> <span m='640000'>transport
  across the membrane during protein synthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>This
  was the first evidence that indicated the signal for secretion</span> <span m='648000'>was
  an N-terminal segment rapidly cleaved upon protein synthesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='652000'>OK. So now there was a student of Palade. He was a post-doctoral</span>
  <span m='656000'>student. His name was Guther Blobel.</span> </p><p><span m='661000'>And
  he saw this experiment in 1971. And he thought how do we know it's</span> <span
  m='666000'>not an artifact of in vitro science? Well, how do you know that the</span>
  <span m='671000'>ribosomes are not just hoping on earlier in the message?</span>
  </p><p><span m='676000'>Maybe that's why it's a longer protein. And he didn't buy
  it.</span> </p><p><span m='682000'>So he wanted to further pursue this. And he did
  it in the</span> <span m='687000'>Palade manner. So what he did was he took a test</span>
  <span m='693000'>tube and he added message for exported protein,</span> <span m='699000'>ribosomes
  and charged tRNAs. And when I say charged tRNAs I mean</span> <span m='705000'>tRNAs
  that have amino acids attached to them. And so if you add those</span> <span m='711000'>three
  things to a test tube you find a protein is made. So then</span> <span m='717000'>he
  added microsomes. What are microsomes?</span> </p><p><span m='722000'>OK. We're
  going to pause this.</span> </p><p><span m='730000'>Now, I told you what Palade
  found out. He found out that proteins</span> <span m='735000'>were first seen in
  the rough ER in the lumen. This is the lumen right</span> <span m='740000'>here.
  This is where he first observed radioactivity.</span> </p><p><span m='746000'>Now,
  if you take endoplasmic reticulum and you share it,</span> <span m='751000'>it forms
  little tiny vesicles, little vesicles with ribosomes on</span> <span m='757000'>the
  outside. And they're called microsomes for</span> <span m='763000'>small things.
  Microsomes. And they're essentially little</span> <span m='769000'>rough endoplasmic
  reticulum vesicles. So when Blobel added to the same</span> <span m='776000'>test
  tube that had the RNA, the ribosomes, the tRNA.</span> </p><p><span m='783000'>When
  he added microsomes he found that the protein was still in the</span> <span m='787000'>supernatant.
  There was no protein found in the lumen of the microsomes.</span> </p><p><span m='792000'>So
  he figured, OK, it needs something.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>Let me go extract
  something from the cytoplasm.</span> </p><p><span m='801000'>And he extracted lots
  of fractions. And he added these cytoplasmic</span> <span m='806000'>fractions.
  And he found that one faction actually was able to cause</span> <span m='810000'>the
  peptide to enter the microsome. And if he added this fraction late</span> <span
  m='815000'>in the reaction, the protein would never get into the</span> <span m='819000'>lumen
  of the microsome. But if he added the fraction late,</span> <span m='824000'>I mean,
  excuse me, early, if he added the faction early they would</span> <span m='829000'>get
  in. So let me just summarize. So message ribosomes, tRNA, you</span> <span m='833000'>find
  protein in the supernatant. Message ribosomes, tRNAs, plus</span> <span m='838000'>microsomes,
  protein in the supernatant, not in the microsomes.</span> </p><p><span m='843000'>You
  add a fraction that works sometimes, but if it's added late</span> <span m='848000'>the
  protein is in the supernatant. But if you add that fraction early</span> <span m='853000'>the
  protein is in the lumen of the microsomes. So he interpreted this</span> <span m='858000'>result
  as that there was an amino acid sequence at the beginning of an</span> <span m='864000'>exported
  protein. And that's recognized by a complex</span> <span m='869000'>that was in
  the fraction. This complex is required to get the</span> <span m='873000'>protein
  to the lumen of the ER. And to get to the lumen of the ER</span> <span m='877000'>the
  protein has to be just beginning to be translated.</span> </p><p><span m='881000'>Now,
  since not all proteins have the same N-terminus,</span> <span m='885000'>Blobel
  predicated, like Milstein, whatever the sequence was it would</span> <span m='888000'>later
  be cleaved. And he won a Nobel Prize for this</span> <span m='892000'>in 1999. And
  it wasn't just for this, because he went on and he</span> <span m='896000'>actually
  figured out the entire pathway.</span> </p><p><span m='900000'>In the next few slides
  I'm going to show you what he discerned.</span> </p><p><span m='905000'>One thing
  I want to just point out, though, the experiment he did was</span> <span m='910000'>heterologous.
  So the extract came from wheat germ,</span> <span m='915000'>the microsomes came
  from dog, and yet it still worked. And it was</span> <span m='920000'>right because
  this pathway is universal. And let me show you how</span> <span m='925000'>universal.
  It's used in bacteria and it's used in eukaryotic cells.</span> </p><p><span m='931000'>So
  here's a bacterium, it's translating a message.</span> </p><p><span m='935000'>Here's
  the signal starting to be translated, it's an exported protein.</span> </p><p><span
  m='940000'>The same thing, in the cytoplasm a signal sequence</span> <span m='945000'>is
  being newly made. And here's a close look of the</span> <span m='950000'>signal
  sequence. It's about 20 amino acids long.</span> </p><p><span m='955000'>It has
  a couple of positive charges at its extreme N-terminus.</span> </p><p><span m='960000'>In
  the middle there's about seven to twelve hydrophobic amino acids</span> <span m='965000'>variable.
  And this called a signal sequence. OK,</span> <span m='970000'>so let's take a look
  at what happens. OK. Now we're in the cytoplasm of</span> <span m='975000'>a eukaryotic
  cell. Here is a signal sequence emerging</span> <span m='980000'>from a ribosome
  here. What recognizes it is SRP.</span> </p><p><span m='985000'>That's what he named
  his complex for signal recognition particle.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>So SRP
  binds to the signal sequence. And, if you recall, it takes it to</span> <span m='996000'>the
  ER to be translated. Here's a picture of the ER.</span> </p><p><span m='1002000'>And
  there's a docking protein or SRP receptor. So the SRP binds to</span> <span m='1008000'>the
  docking protein, it brings with it the signal</span> <span m='1014000'>sequence
  which is attached to the ribosome, which is attached to the</span> <span m='1020000'>message.
  Adjacent to the docking protein is a translocon which is a</span> <span m='1026000'>channel
  composed of proteins. The ribosome pops onto the</span> <span m='1032000'>translocon.
  The SRP floats away. And notice that the signal sequence</span> <span m='1038000'>is
  in the membrane, excuse me, starts to enter through</span> <span m='1044000'>the
  membrane and translation resumes.</span> </p><p><span m='1050000'>The signal sequence
  is cleaved by a signal peptidase within the ER,</span> <span m='1055000'>it cleaves
  off the signal and translation continues.</span> </p><p><span m='1061000'>And if
  it's a fully secreted protein it's fully internalized</span> <span m='1066000'>within
  the lumen of the ER and the ribosome pops up.</span> </p><p><span m='1072000'>If
  it's a membrane protein the signal is cleaved again,</span> <span m='1078000'>translation
  resumes, and then it gets imbedded in the membrane.</span> </p><p><span m='1084000'>And
  so I'm going to shut this off, otherwise it's going to keep going</span> <span m='1088000'>on
  its own here. So if it's a membrane protein what</span> <span m='1093000'>does it
  have? It has a transmembrane stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='1097000'>You've seen
  this maybe before in problem sets. So it's a</span> <span m='1102000'>transmembrane
  stretch.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>Or transmembrane domain. It's about 20,
  22 amino acids long.</span> </p><p><span m='1117000'>It can be 30 maybe. So we'll
  say 20 to 25 amino acids of</span> <span m='1123000'>hydrophobic residues.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1138000'>It is a stop transfer sequence. Stop transfer for going
  across an</span> <span m='1146000'>ER membrane. It anchors it in the membrane.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1154000'>It forms alpha helix.</span> </p><p><span m='1168000'>If
  this part is the lumen of the ER</span> <span m='1184000'>right in here then this
  is the cytoplasm.</span> </p><p><span m='1192000'>OK. So that's how membranes and</span>
  <span m='1201000'>proteins look of this kind. Now, as you can see here,</span> <span
  m='1206000'>it's in the membrane. It's imbedded in the membrane.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1210000'>And I've drawn a different membrane protein over here because this</span>
  <span m='1214000'>protein is going to work its way to the far side of the endoplasmic</span>
  <span m='1218000'>reticulum. OK? As the fully secreted protein will</span> <span
  m='1222000'>also work its way. In the endoplasmic reticulum sugars</span> <span
  m='1226000'>get put on these proteins. So when they get to the far side</span> <span
  m='1230000'>they bleb off into little transport vesicles.</span> </p><p><span m='1234000'>OK?
  So here's the cytoplasmic protein completely within the lumen</span> <span m='1239000'>of
  the vesicle. Here's the membrane protein</span> <span m='1244000'>imbedded in the
  membrane of the vesicle. And if you remember Palade</span> <span m='1250000'>sequence,
  the next stop is the Golgi. So the head over to the Golgi,</span> <span m='1255000'>they
  bind, they fuse, and what was imbedded in the membrane is still</span> <span m='1261000'>imbedded
  in the membrane. And the fully secreted protein is</span> <span m='1266000'>within
  the lumen of the Golgi. Here the sugars are modified. I</span> <span m='1270000'>put
  little bows on them. And they work there way over to the</span> <span m='1275000'>far
  side of the Golgi where they bleb off again into</span> <span m='1279000'>secretory
  vesicles.</span> </p>
