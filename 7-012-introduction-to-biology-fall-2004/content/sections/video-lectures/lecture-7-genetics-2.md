title: 'Lecture 7: Genetics 2'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning. Good morning. Yes. So I want to pick up
  where we</span> <span m='8000'>were last time. We talked last time about Mendel's</span>
  <span m='17000'>elegant experimental design. And not just elegant but very</span>
  <span m='25000'>careful, too, in having organisms that bred true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34000'>And a lot of work went into that. We talked about his observations</span>
  <span m='38000'>and his really great choice to count. We talked about his ability
  to look</span> <span m='43000'>at numbers that were approximate and somehow intuit
  what was interesting</span> <span m='48000'>about them. Namely, he had to take rough
  numbers and say,</span> <span m='53000'>hmm, I think this is a 3:1 ratio, although
  that was an abstraction,</span> <span m='58000'>but a very good on his part. And
  it's hard to know when to make</span> <span m='63000'>those leaps and when you're
  kidding yourself, but Mendel got a lot of</span> <span m='67000'>data. I didn't
  mention that he worked on not just round and</span> <span m='71000'>wrinkled, but
  he worked on seven different traits across pea plants.</span> </p><p><span m='75000'>All
  seven showed these very consistent properties.</span> </p><p><span m='79000'>There
  was a recessive and a dominant phenotype and then a</span> <span m='83000'>first-generation.
  The dominant phenotype by</span> <span m='87000'>definition was evident in full
  force.</span> </p><p><span m='92000'>And in the second-generation we saw 3:1 segregation.</span>
  </p><p><span m='95000'>He felt pretty good about that. He made other predictions
  based on</span> <span m='99000'>this. And he was able to put together a very coherent
  story.</span> </p><p><span m='103000'>And, as I also explained last time, it sunk
  like a stone because it was</span> <span m='106000'>an utterly abstract story, the
  idea that there were these</span> <span m='110000'>particles of inheritance, factors
  of inheritance. You</span> <span m='114000'>couldn't put your finger on them, and
  people hate stuff you cannot put</span> <span m='118000'>your finger on. They say
  it's just a model.</span> </p><p><span m='122000'>Well, as I mentioned last time,
  the discovery of chromosomes in</span> <span m='128000'>cells really laid the foundation
  for the beginning of a rebirth of</span> <span m='134000'>interest in Mendelism,
  in Mendel's ideas. And the</span> <span m='139000'>interesting part of that characterization
  of chromosomes was</span> <span m='145000'>the choreography that we talked about
  last time.</span> </p><p><span m='151000'>That normally in cells undergoing mitosis,
  normal mitotic division to</span> <span m='155000'>make more and more cells, when
  you stained the cells and</span> <span m='159000'>looked at them before they went
  into mitosis you saw these X-like</span> <span m='163000'>structures. However many
  there were, they lined up along the midline of</span> <span m='167000'>the cell.
  They appeared then to sometimes you could even see them</span> <span m='171000'>kind
  of attached to something pulling them back.</span> </p><p><span m='175000'>And they
  would pull back to make two cells each of which</span> <span m='179000'>had half
  of the X. Somebody asked last time,</span> <span m='183000'>I drew four chromosomes,
  was that because cells have four chromosomes?</span> </p><p><span m='187000'>And
  the answer was no. It's because I had room to draw four</span> <span m='191000'>chromosomes
  in that cell. And so this time I drew six</span> <span m='195000'>chromosomes to
  indicate that you can have different numbers of</span> <span m='199000'>chromosomes.
  They are usually, but I should note not always, an</span> <span m='203000'>even
  number of chromosomes in higher organisms. But anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='207000'>So
  I drew six this time. And what's interesting was this</span> <span m='211000'>meiosis.
  The generation of sperm and eggs, for example,</span> <span m='215000'>in animals,
  they are the chromosomes lined up with a different</span> <span m='219000'>choreography.
  They lined up in pairs. And where you could see</span> <span m='223000'>differences
  in the shapes of chromosomes, like maybe the little</span> <span m='227000'>crossing
  point was lowered down or the chromosomes were shorter in</span> <span m='231000'>length,
  there would appear to find their own partner,</span> <span m='235000'>the one that
  had the same basic shape. And they would line up in</span> <span m='239000'>pairs.
  And then they would undergo a series of two divisions,</span> <span m='243000'>a
  meiotic one division, meiosis one and a second division, meiosis two.</span> </p><p><span
  m='247000'>And in meiosis one you would get one copy of each pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='252000'>Then it would undergo a second round of division that looked very</span>
  <span m='258000'>much like mitosis where these X structures would be split into
  two</span> <span m='263000'>pieces. The notion then that pairs would go to singletons
  and then upon</span> <span m='269000'>fertilization singletons would come together
  to reconstitute a pair</span> <span m='275000'>really did fit Mendel. And thus was
  born the Chromosomal</span> <span m='280000'>Theory of Inheritance. So, whoops,
  the Chromosomal Theory</span> <span m='285000'>of Inheritance. Are you overwhelmed
  by the</span> <span m='290000'>Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance? Have I given you
  overwhelming</span> <span m='295000'>evidence to believe it? No. How come?</span>
  </p><p><span m='300000'>It seems natural to you now.</span> </p><p><span m='306000'>But,
  I mean, you know, the only evidence is that there's something</span> <span m='309000'>else
  that has got pairs in cells, right? What's to say that some</span> <span m='313000'>other
  thing that pairs up in cells actually is the carrier of genes?</span> </p><p><span
  m='316000'>The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance is that Mendel's</span> <span m='319000'>abstract
  factors, genes live on these chromosomes,</span> <span m='323000'>are these chromosomes,
  or something like that. They're carried</span> <span m='326000'>by these chromosomes.
  And simply the fact that the</span> <span m='329000'>choreography of the chromosomes
  is not the same, oh,</span> <span m='333000'>sorry, is the same as the choreography
  of Mendel's genes,</span> <span m='336000'>that's correlation. In fact, it's ex
  post facto correlation.</span> </p><p><span m='340000'>I didn't have any prediction
  that these chromosomes would do it.</span> </p><p><span m='343000'>I just saw that
  the chromosomes did it and I said,</span> <span m='347000'>OK, you know, that could
  explain Mendel's observations about genes.</span> </p><p><span m='351000'>And there's
  a world of difference between that could explain,</span> <span m='354000'>that is
  consistent with the data, and that presents a compelling case</span> <span m='358000'>that
  this is true. So there were some people who</span> <span m='361000'>immediately
  bought into the idea of the Chromosomal Theory of</span> <span m='365000'>Inheritance,
  and there were other people who remained great skeptics</span> <span m='368000'>about
  this, that these chromosomes were themselves quite irrelevant to</span> <span m='372000'>inheritance.
  And indeed many people who, at this point,</span> <span m='376000'>the early 20th
  century, felt that the whole business of</span> <span m='379000'>genes was still
  not such an overwhelming idea anyway.</span> </p><p><span m='383000'>And trying
  to unit these two was going a bit far out.</span> </p><p><span m='387000'>So now
  I have to bring you back to some of the things that we left</span> <span m='391000'>unresolved
  last time, which is Mendel's Second Law of</span> <span m='396000'>Inheritance.
  Because if we're really going to start building a</span> <span m='401000'>case that
  chromosomes really do carry genes then we better get some</span> <span m='405000'>serious
  consistency with much more complex aspects of the theory or we</span> <span m='410000'>better
  look for some contradictions. So you recall, and I mentioned,</span> <span m='415000'>that
  Mendel studies seven different traits.</span> </p><p><span m='420000'>Two of them,
  roundness and greenness, both dominant phenotypes underlain</span> <span m='425000'>by
  these hypothetical genes, big R, big R, big G, big G, and the</span> <span m='430000'>recessive
  traits associated with these same genes,</span> <span m='435000'>wrinkled and yellow,
  little R, little R, little G,</span> <span m='441000'>little G. When you make a
  first-generation cross what</span> <span m='446000'>do you get? Sorry? You get round
  and green</span> <span m='451000'>phenotypically. And genotypically what are they?</span>
  </p><p><span m='455000'>Big R, little R, big G, little G, right? That would be the
  genotype.</span> </p><p><span m='459000'>These organisms would be heterozygotes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='464000'>In fact, they would be double heterozygotes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='468000'>They'd be a heterozygote for the gene that controls shape and they'd</span>
  <span m='472000'>be heterozygous for the gene that controls seed color.</span> </p><p><span
  m='477000'>OK? Now, suppose we do a cross back to RRGG, the parent that has</span>
  <span m='481000'>the recessive phenotype for both of these traits.</span> </p><p><span
  m='486000'>We're practicing our words here, right? What will this parent, the</span>
  <span m='491000'>second parent contribute in its gametes? What will the gametes
  from</span> <span m='496000'>that parent be? Little R, little G.</span> </p><p><span
  m='501000'>They have to be little R, little G because that's all it's got</span>
  <span m='506000'>to offer. So little R, little G.</span> </p><p><span m='512000'>OK?
  What will this parent contribute? It could give a big R,</span> <span m='518000'>big
  G. Could give a little R, little G. Could give,</span> <span m='524000'>in principle,
  a little R, big G or a big R, little G.</span> </p><p><span m='530000'>In theory
  any of those are possible. And what's the ratio</span> <span m='536000'>that Mendel
  reports? 1:1:1:1:1, so equal.</span> </p><p><span m='543000'>That's right. 1:1:1:1.
  That's the independent assortment</span> <span m='549000'>of traits. That's what
  he calls this. Independent assortment</span> <span m='555000'>of traits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='565000'>That is to say the inheritance of round and the inheritance
  of green</span> <span m='568000'>are uncorrelated to each other, right?</span> </p><p><span
  m='572000'>Knowing which one you got for roundness, which one you got for</span>
  <span m='576000'>greenness, they don't convey any information about each other.</span>
  </p><p><span m='580000'>So how could we explain this in terms of Chromosomal Theory
  of</span> <span m='585000'>Inheritance? Well, we could explain this in terms of</span>
  <span m='589000'>the Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance by saying,</span> <span m='594000'>for
  example, that in this heterozygous parent here big R and</span> <span m='598000'>little
  R were carried on chromosomes that paired up with each other,</span> <span m='602000'>homologous
  chromosomes. And big G, little G were carried on</span> <span m='607000'>a different
  pair of homologous chromosomes in my meiosis picture</span> <span m='612000'>there.
  OK? So if that was the case then when these chromosomes</span> <span m='617000'>segregated
  in the first meiosis step, meiosis one, it might be that big R</span> <span m='622000'>and
  big G were on the left side. It might be big R and little G were</span> <span m='627000'>on
  the left side. It might be that little R and big G</span> <span m='632000'>were
  on one side, etc. Because these are different</span> <span m='638000'>chromosomes.
  They could have chosen to line up in different ways.</span> </p><p><span m='644000'>That's
  all cool. So Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment is</span> <span m='650000'>consistent
  with the Chromosomal Theory, except we pointed out last</span> <span m='656000'>time,
  except if big R and big G were on the same chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='662000'>Then
  we'd have some explaining to do. So maybe Mendel was just lucky and</span> <span
  m='666000'>big R and big G happened to be on different chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='671000'>But what if he takes a third trait? Well, maybe the reason he got</span>
  <span m='676000'>1:1:1:1 for those traits was it was also on a different chromosome,</span>
  <span m='681000'>a fourth trait. And I said he studied how many traits?</span> </p><p><span
  m='686000'>Seven traits. If they all gave 1:1:1:1 assortment they'd all have</span>
  <span m='691000'>to be on different chromosomes. How many chromosomes do peas have?</span>
  </p><p><span m='696000'>How many pairs of chromosomes do peas have? Seven.</span>
  </p><p><span m='700000'>Very interesting. He might have just gotten lucky.</span>
  </p><p><span m='704000'>In fact, he did. We know that. They are on different chromosomes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='709000'>Though, it makes you wonder whether maybe he had an eighth
  trait that</span> <span m='713000'>did something funny and decided not to put it
  in this paper.</span> </p><p><span m='717000'>I don't know. It's interesting. Like
  I say, there's choice involved</span> <span m='722000'>in what you want to report
  at what point here. So suppose we instead</span> <span m='726000'>had big R and
  big G, little R and little G happen to have</span> <span m='730000'>been on the
  same chromosome. Then they would have been inherited</span> <span m='734000'>from
  the common parent here, say from here into the F1. The F1</span> <span m='739000'>would
  look like this. If they were on different</span> <span m='743000'>chromosomes it
  would look like this. If it were from the same chromosome</span> <span m='747000'>it
  would look like this. And now let's make a little</span> <span m='752000'>scorecard
  of what's going to get passed onto the next generation.</span> </p><p><span m='757000'>We've
  got the possibility that it will pass on. This one could pass</span> <span m='763000'>on.
  Oh, let's keep score. Big R, big G could get passed on.</span> </p><p><span m='768000'>Little
  R, little G could get passed on. Big R, little G could be passed</span> <span m='773000'>on.
  And little R, big G could be passed on.</span> </p><p><span m='779000'>And if they
  are on different chromosomes we expect a quarter,</span> <span m='784000'>a quarter,
  a quarter and a quarter. But if they're on the same</span> <span m='789000'>chromosome
  what do we expect? What will come out of this? Either</span> <span m='793000'>you're
  going to get this, in which case you get both big R and</span> <span m='798000'>big
  G, or you're going to get this one, in which case you get little R</span> <span
  m='803000'>and little G, a half, a half, zero, zero. Ooh,</span> <span m='807000'>that's
  very different. What is Mendel's Law of Independent</span> <span m='812000'>Assortment
  say? It favors this.</span> </p><p><span m='817000'>But Mendel's Law of Independent
  Assortment cannot possibly be right</span> <span m='822000'>if we see this. So Mendel
  didn't observe this.</span> </p><p><span m='827000'>But if we really believe this
  Chromosomal Theory we would expect</span> <span m='832000'>to see it eventually.
  So who's going to be right,</span> <span m='837000'>Mendel or Chromosomal Theory?
  You vote for both.</span> </p><p><span m='843000'>How many vote for Mendel? How
  many vote for Chromosomal</span> <span m='849000'>Theory? How many vote for both?
  How can you have both? The data</span> <span m='855000'>would be contradictory.
  How many vote for neither?</span> </p><p><span m='862000'>Hmm. OK. Fine. So we have
  a very different prediction.</span> </p><p><span m='868000'>Notice that these are
  the parental types of chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='875000'>They're the ones
  that went into the cross in the first place,</span> <span m='879000'>big R and big
  G. These are the non-parental types of chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='883000'>They're
  the ones, they're the combinations, a big R and a big G</span> <span m='887000'>that
  didn't match either of the two parents. That's a new combination.</span> </p><p><span
  m='891000'>Well, it took a while before folks sorted this out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='895000'>And it was eventually sorted out in fruit flies.</span> </p><p><span
  m='900000'>And it is, of course, the case that neither Mendel nor</span> <span m='907000'>this
  strict prediction from the Chromosomal Theory turns out to be</span> <span m='914000'>correct.
  Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment does not hold</span> <span m='921000'>for
  all traits, but this very rigid model of two</span> <span m='928000'>alternatives
  does not hold either. So let's take a look at some real</span> <span m='934000'>data.
  The data comes from Thomas Hunt Morgan, a developmental</span> <span m='938000'>biologist
  who eventually became one of the great geneticists of the</span> <span m='942000'>century
  at Columbia. He was at Columbia University</span> <span m='946000'>studying fruit
  flies. And he studies fruit flies rather</span> <span m='950000'>than peas. Can
  you think of any good reasons why it would make sense</span> <span m='954000'>to
  study fruit flies rather than peas? Sorry? It has four</span> <span m='958000'>chromosomes
  instead of seven. No, four, seven.</span> </p><p><span m='963000'>Anybody been to
  Columbia University? I mean where are you going to plant</span> <span m='966000'>peas,
  right? [LAUGHTER] I mean it's in Manhattan.</span> </p><p><span m='970000'>Also,
  what else is wrong with studying peas?</span> </p><p><span m='974000'>They take
  too long. How many generations of peas are</span> <span m='978000'>you going to
  get a year in Manhattan? Not so many. Fruit flies,</span> <span m='982000'>how long
  do they take? A couple weeks. You get a generation every</span> <span m='986000'>couple
  weeks. If you actually want to write some papers.</span> </p><p><span m='990000'>I
  mean if you have a day job as a monk, you can do these pea things</span> <span m='993000'>that
  take a long time. But, for example, if you were</span> <span m='996000'>trying to
  get tenure at Columbia, you might want to actually do</span> <span m='1000000'>something
  that you could get a couple generations every month or</span> <span m='1003000'>something
  like that. So the fruit fly was much better.</span> </p><p><span m='1007000'>They
  also, you know, they don't take fields and things.</span> </p><p><span m='1010000'>You
  grow them in little vials with some food at the bottom,</span> <span m='1013000'>some
  yeast medium at the bottom and a little cotton stopper at the top.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1017000'>And, you know, it's very convenient. You can grow zillions and zillions</span>
  <span m='1021000'>of fruit flies. So that's why the fruit fly was</span> <span m='1025000'>chosen,
  easy, short generation time, etc. And there are a lot of natural</span> <span m='1030000'>variations
  out there. Geneticists love to choose</span> <span m='1034000'>organisms that are
  just easy to work with so you can do a lot of work.</span> </p><p><span m='1038000'>And
  fruit flies do have four chromosomes. So N equals four.</span> </p><p><span m='1043000'>That
  is four pairs of chromosomes. So he set up a cross. The F0 cross</span> <span m='1047000'>was
  between a normal fly. And the way we say normal in</span> <span m='1052000'>genetics
  in wild type. OK? Wild type. That is the type</span> <span m='1056000'>in the wild.
  It actually doesn't mean that it is the type in the wild.</span> </p><p><span m='1060000'>It
  means it's whatever type the geneticist has chosen as his or her</span> <span m='1064000'>reference
  strain, but it's called wild type.</span> </p><p><span m='1068000'>And he set up
  a cross between a wild type fly,</span> <span m='1072000'>by a fly that had two
  interesting properties. Its body was black and</span> <span m='1076000'>its wings
  were in bad shape, and they were called vestigial.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>You
  know, these funny little wingy things that didn't' work,</span> <span m='1084000'>hadn't
  grown out right, etc. So instead of the normal fly body</span> <span m='1087000'>color,
  which is kind of a tan around its middle, it was black all around</span> <span m='1091000'>its
  middle and its wings were very short. The hypothesis is that there</span> <span
  m='1095000'>were genes controlling. And, in fact, by demonstrating</span> <span
  m='1098000'>Mendelian Inheritance black was a single Mendelian trait which was</span>
  <span m='1102000'>recessive to the normal body color, vestigial was a single Mendelian</span>
  <span m='1106000'>trait which was recessive to the normal body shape.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1110000'>And the genotype of wild type was homozygous normal,</span> <span m='1114000'>which
  I'll write as plus over plus now. Geneticists actually prefer</span> <span m='1118000'>these
  plus terms rather than big Rs and little Rs.</span> </p><p><span m='1122000'>Plus
  over plus. And we'll take a female and we'll</span> <span m='1127000'>cross her
  to a male who is homozygous for the gene that</span> <span m='1131000'>controls
  the body color there and this gene that controls wing shape,</span> <span m='1135000'>and
  we'll look at the offspring. So makes F1.</span> </p><p><span m='1140000'>The F1
  have what genotype? They're plus over black, plus over</span> <span m='1145000'>vestigial
  F1. OK? So then what he does is he takes,</span> <span m='1150000'>say these males,
  and he crosses them back to these flies here that have</span> <span m='1156000'>the
  doubly recessive phenotype doing what we call a test cross.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1161000'>That's now the name. We're beginning to introduce</span> <span m='1167000'>more
  of these names. A test cross, when you cross back to</span> <span m='1172000'>the
  homozygote for the recessive phenotype. And what he gets out,</span> <span m='1176000'>the
  same exact picture I drew before, but we're just getting used to</span> <span m='1181000'>nomenclature
  and getting used to slightly different nomenclatures</span> <span m='1186000'>here.
  He could either get, he always got black, vestigial,</span> <span m='1190000'>black,
  vestigial, black, vestigial from the parent on the right.</span> </p><p><span m='1195000'>And
  here he could get plus, plus, he could get black, vestigial, he</span> <span m='1200000'>could
  get black, plus or he could get plus,</span> <span m='1204000'>vestigial. And, as
  we said over there,</span> <span m='1209000'>the predictions would be that if these
  were on different chromosomes</span> <span m='1214000'>he would get 25%, 25%, 25%,
  25%. If they were on the</span> <span m='1219000'>same chromosome under a very simple
  interpretation of the Chromosomal</span> <span m='1224000'>Theory of Inheritance,
  he would get 50%, 50%, zero, zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1230000'>And, in fact,
  what did he get? 965, 944, 206 and 185. What do you</span> <span m='1238000'>make
  of it? Which theory is confirmed? Neither?</span> </p><p><span m='1246000'>Well,
  maybe this is just a statistical fluctuation</span> <span m='1254000'>around the
  first line.</span> </p><p><span m='1264000'>You don't think so? How come? Way too
  wild.</span> </p><p><span m='1268000'>But, I mean, these are wild type so maybe.
  [LAUGHTER] So do you think</span> <span m='1272000'>those numbers are too far off,
  a quarter, quarter, quarter to be</span> <span m='1276000'>believable? Ooh. Not
  only are they way off 25%,</span> <span m='1280000'>25%, 25%, 25%, but something
  is fishy. The two parental types are</span> <span m='1284000'>much higher than the
  two non-parental types.</span> </p><p><span m='1288000'>That's saying something
  to you. Oh, interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='1292000'>What about this other one,
  50%, 50%, zero, zero? Could this be</span> <span m='1295000'>a fluctuation around
  zero? No. This one is really pretty easy</span> <span m='1298000'>to reject because
  zero, this is not like close to zero.</span> </p><p><span m='1301000'>This should
  be zero. You shouldn't see any of those,</span> <span m='1304000'>right? Because
  they didn't go in if they were on the same chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='1307000'>So
  what are we going to do? We're acting like Mendel,</span> <span m='1310000'>good.
  We're seeing something funny in the data here.</span> </p><p><span m='1313000'>You
  even saw something that is beyond just, it's a little weird,</span> <span m='1316000'>but
  it's actually a little weird in some interesting direction.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1319000'>How many of them are of the parental type?</span> </p><p><span m='1322000'>Well,
  it's 965 plus 944. How many are the non-parental type?</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>It's
  206 plus 185. So let's figure out what's the proportion,</span> <span m='1331000'>the
  frequency of non-parental types.</span> </p><p><span m='1343000'>Well, it's 206
  plus 185 over 206 plus 185 plus 965 plus</span> <span m='1357000'>944, which is
  17%. OK, so it's 17%.</span> </p><p><span m='1366000'>We now know what the answer
  is. When you take two traits and you</span> <span m='1372000'>cross them in this
  fashion, two recessive traits and do a test</span> <span m='1377000'>cross, the
  ratio will neither be 25%, 25%, 25%, 25% or it's not going to</span> <span m='1383000'>be
  50%, 50%, zero, zero. In fact, it will always be 17%.</span> </p><p><span m='1389000'>Why
  not? But Mendel looks at his data, and he said 3:1.</span> </p><p><span m='1396000'>It's
  trying to say 3:1. Isn't this trying to say 17%?</span> </p><p><span m='1403000'>Yeah.
  Well, see, that's the thing, is what to make of this number.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1410000'>What does this 17% mean? Now, of course, you all know that</span> <span
  m='1413000'>this is genetic recombination, right? You know that these</span> <span
  m='1416000'>chromosomes are exchanging material. I cannot kid you about that. But</span>
  <span m='1419000'>put yourself in the days of Thomas Hunt Morgan looking at these
  data</span> <span m='1422000'>and trying to figure out what is this 17% trying to
  tell him.</span> </p><p><span m='1425000'>There were people around Columbia and
  elsewhere who were saying,</span> <span m='1428000'>oh, this 17% number says a lot
  about physiology. It's a statement about</span> <span m='1431000'>the developmental
  relationship of genes. And they were trying to read</span> <span m='1434000'>all
  sorts of things into these numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='1438000'>The first thing
  is let's test some more pairs of traits.</span> </p><p><span m='1442000'>How about
  another pair? If you do that, do you get 17%?</span> </p><p><span m='1447000'>No.
  It turns out maybe you get 8%. You do it with another pair, maybe</span> <span m='1451000'>you
  get 9%. So it's not a constant. We can reject the idea that 17% is</span> <span
  m='1456000'>some constant like e or one over pi or something like that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1460000'>But we look at these numbers, and a lot of folks wanted to</span> <span
  m='1465000'>interpret these as physiological numbers. Something about the</span>
  <span m='1469000'>biology of these traits. So --</span> <span m='1478000'>-- we
  can give this thing a name, the frequency of non-parental types.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1482000'>We can call this the Recombination Rate. Because we've got new</span>
  <span m='1487000'>combinations, right? This recombination rate might mean,</span>
  <span m='1491000'>and you know already that you're thinking what it really means
  is --</span> <span m='1496000'>-- somehow we have black,</span> <span m='1512000'>black,
  plus, plus. And in the F1 we have vestigial,</span> <span m='1519000'>vestigial,
  plus, plus. And that somehow these two</span> <span m='1526000'>chromosomes have
  exchanged genetic material so that the new chromosome</span> <span m='1533000'>you
  get is like this. And you get a recombinant type.</span> </p><p><span m='1539000'>You
  get recombination between these chromosomes. And there's a</span> <span m='1545000'>recombination
  rate. And the recombination rate is how</span> <span m='1551000'>often this kind
  of an exchange occurs. And what does the</span> <span m='1557000'>recombination
  rate depend on? The distance between those two genes.</span> </p><p><span m='1562000'>You
  know this because you've been told this since kindergarten,</span> <span m='1566000'>right?
  It's in all the high school textbooks and things like or</span> <span m='1570000'>whatever.
  They teach genetics earlier and earlier these days and</span> <span m='1575000'>it's
  on TV and stuff. But that's a nice idea that the</span> <span m='1579000'>recombination
  rate depends on the distance. And this rate,</span> <span m='1584000'>which might
  be 17% or it might be 1% or it might be 8% or it might be who</span> <span m='1588000'>knows,
  depends on the distances, reflection of the distance.</span> </p><p><span m='1593000'>But,
  golly, what's the evidence for that? Aren't we just making up a</span> <span m='1596000'>theory
  to explain the data here? We don't have a theory to, we're</span> <span m='1600000'>just
  trying to fix the Chromosomal Theory. The Chromosomal Theory</span> <span m='1604000'>wouldn't
  predict these recombinant types. It would have predicted we</span> <span m='1607000'>only
  get parental types out. So because we do get non-parental</span> <span m='1611000'>types
  out we say, well, chromosomes are promiscuous</span> <span m='1615000'>and they'll
  exchange parts. Because we don't always get the same</span> <span m='1619000'>ratio,
  we have to make up the fact that somehow the ratio is different</span> <span m='1623000'>because
  of something, distance. We cannot observe</span> <span m='1627000'>distance. No
  way that Morgan was able to look at the chromosome and</span> <span m='1632000'>see
  where the genes were. So basically any number you want to</span> <span m='1636000'>give
  him, he'll just say it's the distance. This is not overwhelming.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1641000'>Now, what's even the evidence that chromosomes exchange material?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1645000'>Why do we think stuff like that even happens?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1650000'>Ah, it turns out you can take fruit fly gametes, and other gametes,</span>
  <span m='1654000'>and look at them in the microscope. What you do is to look at
  them</span> <span m='1658000'>closely, the chromosomes during meiosis. You put a
  cover slip on</span> <span m='1663000'>them, you squish them down, add a little
  dye and you look.</span> </p><p><span m='1667000'>And it turns out that really truly,
  when you look in the microscope, you</span> <span m='1672000'>can see stuff like
  that, of chromosomes lying on top of each</span> <span m='1676000'>other like that.
  These are called chiasmata,</span> <span m='1681000'>crosses. Chiasma or the plural
  chiasmata. You can see it in the</span> <span m='1685000'>microscope. So does that
  convincingly demonstrate that</span> <span m='1689000'>recombination occurs? Are
  you overwhelmed? Why not?</span> </p><p><span m='1693000'>Yeah. You put a bunch
  of chromosomes down,</span> <span m='1698000'>you put a glass cover slip and squish
  them. The fact that two</span> <span m='1702000'>things lie on top of each other,
  I mean this is what it takes to do</span> <span m='1706000'>science. Is you actually
  have to be pretty</span> <span m='1710000'>hardnosed about not being willing to
  take evidence that supports your</span> <span m='1713000'>theory just because it
  supports your theory. Skepticism is pretty</span> <span m='1716000'>important here.
  So you squish down the cover slip</span> <span m='1720000'>and sometimes, not always,
  sometimes some</span> <span m='1723000'>chromosome lands on top of some other chromosome.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1726000'>Big deal. So how are we going to actually get any convincing</span>
  <span m='1729000'>predictions? That's what it took with Mendel. What convincing</span>
  <span m='1732000'>predictions can we make that this recombination phenomenon has</span>
  <span m='1735000'>something to do with the disposition of genes along chromosomes?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1739000'>And, if so, might provide some support for the Chromosomal
  Theory</span> <span m='1744000'>of Inheritance? Well, when you're in a quandary,</span>
  <span m='1749000'>you've got some new area, you've got messy data, you need new
  thinking.</span> </p><p><span m='1754000'>Where do you get new thinking from? You
  get new thinking from students</span> <span m='1759000'>because old folks are thinking,
  you know, in whatever way they were</span> <span m='1764000'>thinking. So what you
  really need are young students to come along</span> <span m='1769000'>into the field
  and look at the data in some fresh way.</span> </p><p><span m='1774000'>So, in this
  case, the hero was a UROP student at</span> <span m='1779000'>Columbia. They didn't
  call it UROP, but it was the same thing. He was a</span> <span m='1784000'>sophomore
  working in the lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan who came along</span> <span m='1789000'>and
  solved this problem very nicely. You know, I think in part because</span> <span
  m='1794000'>sophomores had not been polluted by all sorts of prior thinking.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1800000'>So the idea of genetic maps arises through the work of
  one</span> <span m='1805000'>Alfred Sturtevant. Sturtevant was a sophomore at</span>
  <span m='1810000'>Columbia in 1911. And while an undergraduate working</span> <span
  m='1814000'>in the lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan, he went home, you know, he was</span>
  <span m='1818000'>working in the lab, and he took home a pile of data.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1822000'>And he said I've got to make sense out of all this data.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1826000'>I don't understand exactly what's going on.</span> </p><p><span m='1830000'>Here's
  some of the data he took home. Morgan's lab had set up crosses,</span> <span m='1834000'>not
  just involving two traits but three traits simultaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='1839000'>They
  actually set up crosses involving three traits,</span> <span m='1843000'>black,
  what's called cinnabar which is an eye color,</span> <span m='1848000'>and vestigial.
  And they looked at the F1 when crossing back to the</span> <span m='1852000'>triply
  homozygous fly here, and they counted the number of</span> <span m='1857000'>recombinant
  types of different sorts.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>You could look at recombinant
  types between black and vestigial.</span> </p><p><span m='1865000'>We've already
  got that data. You could look at recombinant types</span> <span m='1868000'>between
  black and cinnabar. You could look at recombinant types</span> <span m='1871000'>between
  cinnabar and vestigial. Now, I've drawn this as if these</span> <span m='1874000'>live
  on a chromosome and I know their order. You've got to remember,</span> <span m='1877000'>we
  don't know that they live on a chromosome. And Sturtevant</span> <span m='1880000'>certainly
  didn't know their order. OK? But I have to draw it for you,</span> <span m='1883000'>so
  I'm drawing it for you because the notation he would have used was</span> <span
  m='1886000'>much too messy and there's no point in learning it.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1890000'>So he begins to look at the data from these different crosses.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1896000'>What he finds is when he looks only at black and vestigial,</span>
  <span m='1902000'>so he ignores what happened with cinnabar, what's the recombination</span>
  <span m='1909000'>rate, the frequency with which he observes new types,</span> <span
  m='1915000'>non-parental types? Well, they had already done the</span> <span m='1921000'>experiment
  in the lab. And what's the answer?</span> </p><p><span m='1925000'>17%. Now, he
  then looks at black to cinnabar. So he just,</span> <span m='1929000'>you know,
  covers up the genotype of vestigial. There are four</span> <span m='1933000'>possibilities,
  black, cinnabar,</span> <span m='1938000'>black, plus, plus, cinnabar, black, cinnabar.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1942000'>He looks at the parental types, black, cinnabar or plus,
  plus. He</span> <span m='1946000'>looks at the non-parental types, the recombinant
  types, plus,</span> <span m='1950000'>cinnabar or black, plus. He counts up the
  number of</span> <span m='1954000'>non-parental types to the total number of flies
  and he gets a</span> <span m='1956000'>recombination rate of 9%. OK? So I'm just
  going to draw you</span> <span m='1959000'>this. He took out a piece of paper and
  he drew himself black,</span> <span m='1961000'>cinnabar, vestigial. He said I believe
  this has something to do</span> <span m='1964000'>with distance. This was 17%. The
  probability of a</span> <span m='1967000'>crossover occurring, of a recombination
  occurring between</span> <span m='1969000'>black and vestigial 17%. And the probability
  of a crossover</span> <span m='1972000'>occurring, the frequency of a crossover
  occurring between black</span> <span m='1974000'>and cinnabar was 9%. Got any prediction?
  Cinnabar,</span> <span m='1977000'>vestigial should be about 8%, give or take.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1980000'>But what if his picture is wrong. What's another picture
  that might</span> <span m='1989000'>be were cinnabar is? Oh, yeah. There's an alternative</span>
  <span m='1999000'>picture, isn't there? The alternative picture is black,</span>
  <span m='2009000'>vestigial, cinnabar over here at 9%, 17%. In which case, what's
  the</span> <span m='2019000'>prediction for cinnabar, vestigial? 26%, give or take,</span>
  <span m='2029000'>right? We've got to be a little rough about these things.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2039000'>Well, that's not a single prediction, but it's down to
  two alternatives.</span> </p><p><span m='2044000'>He's either expecting about 8%
  or he's expecting about 26%.</span> </p><p><span m='2049000'>So two alternative
  predictions.</span> </p><p><span m='2065000'>Cinnabar, vestigial combination rate
  8%. Mm, that's good.</span> </p><p><span m='2072000'>That's very good. The first
  time anybody's made a prediction,</span> <span m='2079000'>and a quantitative prediction
  that's just gotten verified by data.</span> </p><p><span m='2086000'>Sturtevant
  also does one other interesting thing.</span> </p><p><span m='2093000'>He looks
  at a fourth thing, which is a little bit interesting.</span> </p><p><span m='2100000'>When
  I look at the types of gametes that can come out of her,</span> <span m='2104000'>right?
  If this idea of genetic recombination is correct,</span> <span m='2108000'>that
  sometimes in this F1 parent a crossover has occurred here,</span> <span m='2113000'>sometimes
  a crossover has occurred here, and the crossover here would</span> <span m='2117000'>give
  rise to black, plus, plus or plus, cinnabar,</span> <span m='2122000'>vestigial.
  Here it would give rise to black, cinnabar,</span> <span m='2126000'>plus or plus,
  plus, vestigial if it went the other way.</span> </p><p><span m='2131000'>Is it
  possible that occasionally, under this model, you might get two</span> <span m='2137000'>crossovers?
  Might it be the case, if we believe in this stuff, that a</span> <span m='2143000'>crossover
  might occur between black and cinnabar and a crossover might</span> <span m='2150000'>occur
  between vestigial and cinnabar? Could be. How often do you think</span> <span m='2156000'>that
  would happen? Sorry? Rarely.</span> </p><p><span m='2162000'>How rarely? What's
  the chance of a crossover here?</span> </p><p><span m='2166000'>About 9%, right?
  A crossover here?</span> </p><p><span m='2170000'>About 8%. Let's say 9%, 8% or
  about 10% just for roundness.</span> </p><p><span m='2174000'>There's about a 10%
  chance of a crossover in the first interval.</span> </p><p><span m='2179000'>It's
  about a 10% chance of a crossover in the second interval.</span> </p><p><span m='2183000'>It's
  about 1% of the time. Much lower than the others.</span> </p><p><span m='2187000'>But
  about 1% of the time you might see what kind of chromosomes</span> <span m='2191000'>emerging?
  Black plus, vestigial.</span> </p><p><span m='2197000'>So black plus, vestigial
  or plus, cinnabar, vestigial. These</span> <span m='2203000'>chromosomes, oops,
  plus. Thank you. These would be</span> <span m='2209000'>doubly recombinant chromosomes.
  They would need two recombination</span> <span m='2215000'>events to explain them.
  And you even have a prediction that</span> <span m='2221000'>you might see them
  at about 1%. And, sure enough,</span> <span m='2225000'>Sturtevant sees them. It's
  actually somewhat less than 1%.</span> </p><p><span m='2229000'>It turns out that
  double is a little less likely than the</span> <span m='2232000'>independent. There's
  a little bit of what's called interference,</span> <span m='2235000'>but don't worry
  about it. That's a second order effect.</span> </p><p><span m='2239000'>At a frequency
  of about 1% he sees double recombinants.</span> </p><p><span m='2242000'>That tells
  him who is in the middle. If cinnabar is the one that has</span> <span m='2246000'>this
  property, because if he asked how often does</span> <span m='2249000'>cinnabar get
  inherited together with plus, plus that's very rare.</span> </p><p><span m='2253000'>But
  vestigial gets inherited with plus, plus 9% of the time,</span> <span m='2258000'>black
  gets inherited with plus, plus, sorry, 8% or 9% of the time,</span> <span m='2264000'>but
  cinnabar is pretty rare. So all this together says that this model</span> <span
  m='2270000'>here of a linear chromosome is now making some pretty good quantitative</span>
  <span m='2276000'>predictions about what's going on. But of course this is just
  three</span> <span m='2281000'>different genes, black, cinnabar and vestigial.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2285000'>What would you like? More of them at least. Me,</span>
  <span m='2289000'>personally, I go for all. I'm with you. But he's an</span> <span
  m='2293000'>undergraduate and he's got what he can. So more.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2297000'>Well, it turns out that of course Morgan's lab was busily making</span>
  <span m='2301000'>crosses and all this kind of stuff and there was more data available.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2305000'>So when he saw this happening he said, all right, let's
  look</span> <span m='2309000'>at some more things. And he began, because there was
  so</span> <span m='2314000'>much data from the lab, going around and taking all
  this</span> <span m='2318000'>stuff, lobe and curved wing and other kinds of funny
  traits,</span> <span m='2323000'>and he began looking at frequencies. And he found
  this was about 9%.</span> </p><p><span m='2327000'>And this was about 8%. And he
  found this was about 5%.</span> </p><p><span m='2332000'>And he found that this
  was about 5%. And if these two were 5%</span> <span m='2336000'>his prediction was
  10%. And his prediction here would be 13%,</span> <span m='2341000'>etc. And it
  all pretty closely checked out. This was highly</span> <span m='2346000'>constrained,
  the idea that the recombination rates would fit a</span> <span m='2351000'>simple
  linear model. It's not perfect, of course,</span> <span m='2357000'>because imagine
  what happens. Suppose I have 10%,</span> <span m='2362000'>10%, 10%, 10%, 10% and
  I have ten loci, you know, I have</span> <span m='2367000'>ten such intervals. What
  will the recombination rate be?</span> </p><p><span m='2371000'>100%. And then if
  have five more? 150%. What does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='2375000'>So clearly
  something is wrong about just using percents.</span> </p><p><span m='2378000'>You
  have to kind of, I mean for the aficionados,</span> <span m='2382000'>really the
  percent reflects the number of crossovers.</span> </p><p><span m='2385000'>But obviously
  you have to do a little bit of correction because you</span> <span m='2389000'>cannot
  have, you know, if I keep piling on the intervals</span> <span m='2392000'>double
  crossovers will happen which won't produce recombinant types.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2396000'>But don't worry about it. We can just add percentages for today.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2400000'>And when you do all this it works. Sturtevant did this
  all in one</span> <span m='2404000'>evening. In his autobiography that he wrote
  about 50 years later he</span> <span m='2408000'>says I went home one evening, blew
  off all of my homework, and</span> <span m='2412000'>stayed up all night and was
  able to make sense out of all this data.</span> </p><p><span m='2417000'>So I think
  this is an example of a productive all-nighter.</span> </p><p><span m='2421000'>[LAUGHTER]
  And also this is an example of when it's the right</span> <span m='2425000'>choice
  to blow off your homework. If anyone wishes to do things like</span> <span m='2429000'>this
  and be as productive, you're certainly entitled to blow</span> <span m='2433000'>off
  the homework here, too. But do bring in good data like</span> <span m='2436000'>this
  when you're done. Anyway, this notion is a genetic</span> <span m='2440000'>map.
  A genetic map was a totally abstract concept,</span> <span m='2444000'>much like
  Mendel's abstract concept that there were even genes.</span> </p><p><span m='2447000'>Now
  we're going further and we're saying whatever genes are,</span> <span m='2451000'>we
  still don't know that they're DNA, etc. Whatever they are they live on</span> <span
  m='2454000'>a line, and they behave as if they live on a line,</span> <span m='2458000'>and
  they undergo recombinations, etc.</span> </p><p><span m='2462000'>And when I see
  a recombination rate, a recombination frequency, a</span> <span m='2465000'>recombination
  rate that's zero, it must mean the genes are very</span> <span m='2469000'>close
  together. If I see a recombination rate very,</span> <span m='2473000'>very close,
  never recombine, recombination rates,</span> <span m='2477000'>oh, I don't know,
  maybe 10% or something, well,</span> <span m='2481000'>there's some distance between
  them. And if they're further and further</span> <span m='2485000'>and further away,
  or on totally different chromosomes,</span> <span m='2489000'>what would be the
  recombination rate here for two different chromosomes?</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>A
  half. Half of these are non-parental types.</span> </p><p><span m='2497000'>So when
  I get up to a recombination rate of 50% then it means that they</span> <span m='2502000'>live
  on, that they are so-called unlinked to each other.</span> </p><p><span m='2506000'>Either
  they are on different chromosomes entirely or I suppose</span> <span m='2511000'>it's
  possible, and in fact it is possible that</span> <span m='2516000'>they're so far
  away on the same chromosome that the probability of</span> <span m='2520000'>crossovers
  occurring is so high that they are de-correlated from each</span> <span m='2525000'>other
  and I cannot observe any recombination rate less than 50%,</span> <span m='2530000'>It
  turns out many chromosomes are sufficiently big that lots of</span> <span m='2533000'>crossovers
  can occur and you cannot actually detect linkage at the two</span> <span m='2536000'>ends
  of the chromosome. But if you string together some</span> <span m='2539000'>genes
  in between you can see that this is linked to this is linked to</span> <span m='2543000'>this
  is linked to this is linked to this is linked to this.</span> </p><p><span m='2546000'>OK?
  All right. Good. So Sturtevant is another one of my</span> <span m='2550000'>heroes
  because he comes up with this utterly abstract model here of</span> <span m='2555000'>chromosomes,
  of genetic maps. All right. I meant to get that</span> <span m='2560000'>board.
  Does someone have a call? OK. So last of all let me take</span> <span m='2565000'>Section
  4 here. This begins to provide fairly</span> <span m='2570000'>convincing evidence
  for the Chromosomal Theory because it made a</span> <span m='2575000'>whole lot
  of pretty whacky predictions.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>And they pretty much
  hold up. Here's another thing that provided</span> <span m='2585000'>a lot of good
  evidence for it, and that was sex linkage.</span> </p><p><span m='2590000'>Also
  in Morgan's lab,</span> <span m='2596000'>which was a very productive place, I must
  say, folks were wondering</span> <span m='2601000'>about the fact that chromosomes,
  although they almost always occurred</span> <span m='2607000'>in pairs that lined
  up with each other perfectly,</span> <span m='2612000'>in many species there was
  one odd couple.</span> </p><p><span m='2618000'>A pair of chromosomes that always
  paired up with each other but they</span> <span m='2624000'>didn't look the same.
  This one looks like an X.</span> </p><p><span m='2630000'>This one kind of had the
  shape of a Y. And hence they got the names the</span> <span m='2636000'>X and the
  Y chromosomes. Now here was something very</span> <span m='2642000'>interesting.
  In fruit flies it was always the males that had an XY pair.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2646000'>In females it was always an XX pair. What does that tell us about these</span>
  <span m='2651000'>chromosomes and what they do? Sorry? Determines gender. Wait a</span>
  <span m='2655000'>minute. Why do you believe it determines gender?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2659000'>It just correlated with gender. Females have these two funny</span>
  <span m='2664000'>chromosomes. Males have, I'm sorry. Females have these two</span>
  <span m='2668000'>Xs. Males have an X and Y.</span> </p><p><span m='2672000'>Does
  it have to mean that they determine gender?</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>Maybe
  gender determines them. Maybe what happens is that in</span> <span m='2680000'>female
  cells you get both chromosomes, but in male cells some</span> <span m='2683000'>enzyme
  comes along and chews off the end of the chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='2687000'>No,
  no, really. Maybe this is some physiological state of the</span> <span m='2690000'>chromosomes.
  Why are you so ready to leap to the conclusion that the</span> <span m='2694000'>chromosomes
  determine sex, rather the gender, than the gender</span> <span m='2698000'>determines
  the chromosomes? It's because you know the answer,</span> <span m='2702000'>you've
  been told all this, etc. But I, again, invite you to take apart</span> <span m='2706000'>what
  support you have for that and ask how would you know,</span> <span m='2710000'>right?
  All of these things you get told, but how would you know?</span> </p><p><span m='2714000'>And
  there was great argument about was this really the case?</span> </p><p><span m='2718000'>So
  how could you convince people that this was true?</span> </p><p><span m='2722000'>It's
  not obvious to know which way it would go.</span> </p><p><span m='2727000'>The most
  convincing evidence, not the only evidence, but the most</span> <span m='2732000'>convincing
  evidence came from a single fly that had been isolated in</span> <span m='2737000'>Morgan's
  lab. And F0 fly that had the very interesting property that</span> <span m='2743000'>instead
  of the normal red drosophila eyes this fly had white eyes.</span> </p><p><span m='2748000'>Whereas,
  this was the normal fly with red eyes. And we'll</span> <span m='2754000'>use a
  female here. When you cross together the white</span> <span m='2758000'>eyed fly
  and the red eyed fly, what you find is that in the F1</span> <span m='2761000'>generation
  all the flies, males and females, are normal red</span> <span m='2765000'>eyes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2772000'>When I take, however, a normal female and I cross her back,</span>
  <span m='2780000'>sorry. A normal female emerging from this F1 generation,</span>
  <span m='2788000'>and now I cross her to a normal male, here's what happens.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2796000'>All of her daughters are normal, but her sons, half are
  normal and</span> <span m='2810000'>half are white-eyed again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2827000'>That's weird. For the first time we have a genetic trait,</span> <span
  m='2833000'>eye color, that is showing correlation in its inheritance with</span>
  <span m='2839000'>sex. So that says for the first time we're beginning to see</span>
  <span m='2845000'>something that looks like linkage, like genetic correlation, genetic</span>
  <span m='2851000'>nearness, like genetic mapping that would relate eye color to
  sex.</span> </p><p><span m='2858000'>What's the model? Well, of course the model
  here is</span> <span m='2862000'>that this fly, we know the answer,</span> <span
  m='2867000'>is X over Y, it's a male. And the X chromosome here has a</span> <span
  m='2872000'>mutation that makes it white-eyed. What's this normal fly over here?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2877000'>X over X. And its X chromosomes are normal.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2882000'>When we go to the next generation, what kind of offspring are there?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2887000'>The daughters of this cross, what's their genotype? What
  did</span> <span m='2893000'>they get from dad? They always get a normal X</span>
  <span m='2898000'>chromosome from dad. I'm sorry, from mom I mean.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2903000'>What did they get from dad, these daughters? They always got the X</span>
  <span m='2909000'>with the white eye. Why didn't they get the Y?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2914000'>Because they're daughters, right? If they got the Y they'd be</span>
  <span m='2920000'>sons. But they're daughters. So the daughters always are getting</span>
  <span m='2925000'>this chromosome. Now, when you mate these back to a</span> <span
  m='2930000'>normal male, X over Y, the daughters are of what type?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2936000'>What did they get from their dad? Always an X plus.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2941000'>And what did they get from their mom? Either an X with a mutation or</span>
  <span m='2946000'>an X plus. Either way they're normal, because we're assuming that</span>
  <span m='2951000'>this white-eyed mutation is recessive. What did the sons get?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2956000'>What did they get from their dad? Y. Why don't they get
  the X?</span> </p><p><span m='2961000'>Because they're sons. What did they get from
  their mom?</span> </p><p><span m='2967000'>Half of them get the X plus, half of
  them get the X mutant,</span> <span m='2971000'>and that explains cleanly what's
  going on. Now,</span> <span m='2975000'>the Y chromosome, being a short stubby little</span>
  <span m='2979000'>chromosome, doesn't have a copy of this gene for eye color at
  all.</span> </p><p><span m='2983000'>So you might as well regard it as being, you
  know,</span> <span m='2987000'>recessive, as carrying the allele for the recessive
  trait.</span> </p><p><span m='2991000'>It doesn't have any functional copy. So for
  a male he only</span> <span m='2995000'>gets a copy from mom. And what he got from
  mom completely</span> <span m='3000000'>determines his phenotype. Thus, the transmission
  of eye color,</span> <span m='3005000'>a trait controlled by a gene on the X chromosome
  correlated so</span> <span m='3009000'>beautifully with the transmission of the
  trait sex.</span> </p><p><span m='3014000'>That provided a convincing argument that
  it was the chromosomes</span> <span m='3019000'>controlling sex rather than the
  sex controlling chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='3024000'>All right. So you know
  all this stuff. You've all heard of Mendel.</span> </p><p><span m='3029000'>You've
  all heard of recombination. You've heard of, I suppose, genetic</span> <span m='3032000'>maps.
  You know about X and Y chromosomes and things like that.</span> </p><p><span m='3036000'>What
  I want you to take away from all of this is that in order to</span> <span m='3040000'>really
  know things you have to struggle against models.</span> </p><p><span m='3044000'>You
  have to understand whether the model is just being made up to</span> <span m='3048000'>explain
  the data or whether the model has been proved by testing it</span> <span m='3052000'>in
  any serious kinds of ways. All this stuff took 30 or 40 years</span> <span m='3056000'>of
  serious battle before the last people caved in and said this is all</span> <span
  m='3060000'>proven. Of course, going forward we'll assume it's all</span> <span
  m='3065000'>proven and you know what to do with it. And onward to next time.</span>
