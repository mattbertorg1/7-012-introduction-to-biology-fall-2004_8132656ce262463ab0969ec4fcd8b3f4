transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning. All right. So, it was a lot of fun to
  tell you</span> <span m='5000'>last time about the work that's going on here at
  MIT in genomics.</span> </p><p><span m='10000'>It's, it's just fun. I mean it's
  fun to share what's going on and</span> <span m='16000'>it's fun that you guys can
  understand what's going on already</span> <span m='21000'>with simply one semester
  of biology, which I think is really cool.</span> </p><p><span m='27000'>What I would
  like to do today is talk about another exciting area,</span> <span m='30000'>one
  I don't work in, but one that I know many people are interested in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='34000'>And I would like to lay the foundations for neurobiology.</span> </p><p><span
  m='38000'>Neurobiology is an incredibly interesting area.</span> </p><p><span m='42000'>I
  confess it's the subject that got me interested in biology in the</span> <span m='45000'>first
  place, even though I don't work on it itself.</span> </p><p><span m='49000'>And,
  I mean, who can't be interested in the brain.</span> </p><p><span m='53000'>But
  if you want to take on the brain, you really have to understand</span> <span m='57000'>its
  working components in some retail detail.</span> </p><p><span m='61000'>And so what
  we're going to focus on in this course for the next three</span> <span m='66000'>lectures
  is the specific molecular mechanism by which nerve cells are</span> <span m='71000'>able
  to transmit signals down their length, how they're able to transmit</span> <span
  m='76000'>signals from one cell to the next, and then how they're able to change</span>
  <span m='81000'>their properties over time, that is learn and remember.</span> </p><p><span
  m='87000'>So, the fundamental unit of neurological processing is a nerve</span>
  <span m='94000'>cell which goes by the name a neuron. You have approximately ten
  to the</span> <span m='102000'>twelfth neurons.</span> </p><p><span m='111000'>How
  many bases are in the human genome?</span> </p><p><span m='113000'>About three times
  ten to the ninth.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>So, you have a lot more nerve cells
  than bases in the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='124000'>So, it's unlikely that
  all of the wiring diagram is completely</span> <span m='128000'>specified in the
  sequence of the genome simply because we have a lot</span> <span m='133000'>of them
  here. That's just a minor side point. And what does a typical</span> <span m='137000'>neuron
  look like? So, neurons and connections.</span> </p><p><span m='142000'>So, a neuron.
  Well,</span> <span m='150000'>a typical neuron, your ten to the twelfth neurons
  makes contacts with</span> <span m='158000'>other neurons. It might receive contacts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='167000'>It might get contacts from, oh, ten to the third other neurons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='176000'>And sends signals to ten to the third other neurons.</span>
  </p><p><span m='185000'>So, that's a lot of connections if you figure ten to the
  third times</span> <span m='189000'>ten to the twelfth. Ten to the fifteenth connections
  in</span> <span m='193000'>this circuit diagram. Here's sort of a, kind of a picture</span>
  <span m='197000'>of a nerve cell --</span> <span m='204000'>-- making connections
  to another nerve cell. Making connections to</span> <span m='214000'>maybe a muscle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='224000'>Oh, and what activates this nerve cell? Well, maybe in your
  eye we</span> <span m='228000'>have a photoreceptor cell.</span> </p><p><span m='234000'>And
  that photo receptor cell will synapse upon a first neuron which</span> <span m='238000'>will
  synapse on a second neuron which will synapse on your muscle.</span> </p><p><span
  m='242000'>So maybe you'll see something, send a signal, send a signal,</span> <span
  m='246000'>activate your muscle to pick it up. Needless to say, it's pretty much</span>
  <span m='250000'>more complicated than that because it will take more than those
  two</span> <span m='254000'>neurons to figure out this is a piece of chalk and how
  to coordinate</span> <span m='258000'>that whole motion and all, but you get the
  idea. So, let's</span> <span m='262000'>just take a look at some of these pieces
  here. What kinds of</span> <span m='266000'>receptors might we have? We might have
  receptor neurons that</span> <span m='271000'>receive light --</span> <span m='283000'>--
  called photoreceptors.</span> </p><p><span m='289000'>And these photoreceptors in
  your eye are an extraordinary piece of</span> <span m='294000'>engineering. Do you
  know how sensitive a photoreceptor can be?</span> </p><p><span m='300000'>What's
  the absolutely minimum possible detectable unit of light?</span> </p><p><span m='305000'>One
  photon. It turns out your photoreceptors can,</span> <span m='311000'>under appropriate
  circumstances, detect a single photon. Not in the</span> <span m='316000'>bright
  right but in dark adapted conditions, you actually have on</span> <span m='322000'>photon
  sensitivity. Very impressive.</span> </p><p><span m='328000'>Under appropriate conditions,
  mind you. Sound receptors. You've</span> <span m='332000'>got sound receptors in
  your ear and they are beautiful.</span> </p><p><span m='336000'>We're not going
  to talk about them at any length,</span> <span m='340000'>but there's little flappy,
  these little spiky things going</span> <span m='344000'>along in your ear and they
  can translate vibrational energy coming</span> <span m='349000'>from your ear, hurting
  your eardrum,</span> <span m='353000'>being translated into a vibration into the
  fluid in your ear into a</span> <span m='357000'>physical motion of these little
  receptors there into an electrical</span> <span m='361000'>motion, into an electrical
  signal that goes into your ear.</span> </p><p><span m='366000'>So, all of that,
  all of that's pretty impressive</span> <span m='369000'>stuff. We're not going to
  talk about the details of it,</span> <span m='372000'>but I invite some of you who
  want to learn more about this,</span> <span m='375000'>particularly MIT students
  I think find receptors really quite</span> <span m='378000'>remarkable kinds of
  devices. We're going to focus, though,</span> <span m='381000'>more on this intermediate
  step here of a generic neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='384000'>So, here's my generic
  neuron. And the first thing that has to be</span> <span m='388000'>said is there
  are no generic neurons. Neurons are all very specific,</span> <span m='392000'>but
  I'm just going to use a generic neuron for the moment.</span> </p><p><span m='397000'>And
  the important features of a generic neuron here,</span> <span m='401000'>it has
  these funny little processes on its cell body that are called</span> <span m='405000'>dendrites.
  That's where it's going to receive signals.</span> </p><p><span m='410000'>Processes
  are the name for things that stick out.</span> </p><p><span m='414000'>So, these
  processes are called dendrites.</span> </p><p><span m='419000'>Here's our nucleus
  of our cell. Here's our cell body. We will</span> <span m='425000'>label this your
  cell body with a nucleus in it.</span> </p><p><span m='431000'>Then we have this
  very long process here called an axon.</span> </p><p><span m='437000'>The axon is
  the wire here. This region here is called the axon</span> <span m='443000'>hillock
  and it looks like a little hill. That's what hillock means,</span> <span m='449000'>it's
  a little sort of hill-like region here.</span> </p><p><span m='455000'>And it's
  where all the electrical signals from the cell body are</span> <span m='459000'>integrated
  and a, quote, decision is made about</span> <span m='463000'>whether to fire. And
  the neuron will then fire a</span> <span m='467000'>signal down the length of its
  axon and then it will get to the end here</span> <span m='471000'>where we have
  these terminal processes that'll be synapsing on</span> <span m='475000'>other cells
  here. These are called nerve terminals.</span> </p><p><span m='480000'>And each
  will make connections either with other dendrites or maybe</span> <span m='484000'>with
  a muscle, although you wouldn't see both of</span> <span m='488000'>those occurring,
  so I'm just drawing this for</span> <span m='492000'>illustration purposes here.
  And it will send a signal. And</span> <span m='497000'>these points of contact are
  called synapses. So,</span> <span m='501000'>nerve or muscle. OK? So, that's your
  general</span> <span m='505000'>picture there. You have a synapse which transmits.</span>
  </p><p><span m='510000'>This is an electrical signal. This is typically a chemical
  signal.</span> </p><p><span m='515000'>And, as you might imagine, the pre-synaptic
  cell is this guy,</span> <span m='520000'>the post-synaptic cell is that guy. So,
  I'll say pre-synaptic and</span> <span m='526000'>post-synaptic. And what neurobiologists
  want to do</span> <span m='531000'>is understand how does this all work? How does
  the initial signal impinge</span> <span m='537000'>upon the dendrite from a synapse?
  How does that signal get collected</span> <span m='541000'>and integrated into a
  decision about whether to fire an action potential</span> <span m='544000'>that
  runs along the nerve? And then how does that get</span> <span m='548000'>transmitted
  from an electrical signal back into a chemical signal</span> <span m='551000'>which
  then restarts an electrical signal in the next cell,</span> <span m='554000'>etc.,
  etc., etc? Those are some of the kinds of questions we want to</span> <span m='558000'>ask.
  Now, I said generic neuron. Of course there's really nothing</span> <span m='561000'>generic
  about it. Some neurons are very tiny.</span> </p><p><span m='564000'>Some neurons
  are very big. What's the typical size of an ordinary</span> <span m='568000'>eukaryotic
  cell in a liver cell? Ballpark. Ten microns.</span> </p><p><span m='572000'>So,
  a typical eukaryotic cell might be --</span> <span m='577000'>-- and ten microns.</span>
  </p><p><span m='589000'>But a neuron can be anywhere from that size, ten microns,</span>
  <span m='596000'>all the way up to three meters. Where's the longest neuron known?</span>
  </p><p><span m='602000'>Squid giant axon. That's possible, actually. I'm not sure
  how big</span> <span m='606000'>squid, I mean there are these giant squids and they
  may qualify.</span> </p><p><span m='611000'>The longest one that I know of is in
  a similar sort of setting.</span> </p><p><span m='615000'>It's in the giraffe. It's
  a motor neuron in the neck of the giraffe</span> <span m='619000'>which runs three
  meters, a single cell. But these monstrous</span> <span m='624000'>squids that,
  at least in stories, glom onto boats might actually get</span> <span m='628000'>up
  there. Will somebody check the squid,</span> <span m='633000'>the largest squid
  on record here? I might need to revise that. But</span> <span m='637000'>the largest
  one I know about definitively is the giraffe that has</span> <span m='641000'>single
  neurons three meters long. Ten foot long single cells. So,</span> <span m='645000'>it's
  really very impressive what a cell can do there.</span> </p><p><span m='649000'>So,
  I'll put down the giraffe but we'll check out on the squid there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='653000'>Giraffe neck. OK. So, what are the kinds of questions that</span> <span
  m='657000'>we might want to ask? Well, the kinds of questions we</span> <span m='662000'>might
  want to ask about this process, and I'm not going to be able to</span> <span m='667000'>answer
  all of them but I'll get them up here. So, how do receptors</span> <span m='672000'>transduce
  signals --</span> <span m='679000'>-- from the outside world?</span> </p><p><span
  m='686000'>Light, sounds, touch, etc.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>That's a good
  question. People know a lot about it.</span> </p><p><span m='700000'>How do electrical
  signals propagate along the neuron?</span> </p><p><span m='705000'>Along an axon?</span>
  </p><p><span m='712000'>People know a lot about that one, and that's what we're
  going to</span> <span m='715000'>discuss today.</span> </p><p><span m='722000'>How
  do signals transmit across a synapse?</span> </p><p><span m='725000'>We'll talk
  about that,</span> <span m='732000'>some today and some next time. And how do they
  transmit them to</span> <span m='737000'>effector cells? So how do signals transmit</span>
  <span m='742000'>specifically to effector cells like a muscle?</span> </p><p><span
  m='748000'>We'll talk about that.</span> </p><p><span m='756000'>Then how does the
  pattern of connections --</span> <span m='764000'>-- give rise to a computation?</span>
  </p><p><span m='770000'>That's pretty tricky.</span> </p><p><span m='778000'>We'll
  talk just a teeny little bit about the simplest kind of</span> <span m='783000'>computation,
  but the complex computations of recognizing that</span> <span m='788000'>that's
  somebody's Volkswagen or that that's your grandmother or something</span> <span
  m='793000'>are still beyond us today. But we know things in between that.</span>
  </p><p><span m='798000'>How does this pattern of connections arise during development?</span>
  </p><p><span m='803000'>That's a fascinating question. And a lot is known about
  it, but</span> <span m='808000'>we're not going to talk about it in this course.</span>
  </p><p><span m='813000'>How does this pattern of connections get modified by experience?</span>
  </p><p><span m='820000'>That's something that we'll mention briefly on Friday that
  a colleague</span> <span m='827000'>of mine who's very knowledgeable about this
  is going to give.</span> </p><p><span m='834000'>And that's learning and memory.
  And then how does this all give</span> <span m='841000'>rise to consciousness?</span>
  </p><p><span m='852000'>And we haven't got the first clue. We have no idea. It's
  fascinating.</span> </p><p><span m='856000'>I digress for a second. A famous biologist,
  J.B.</span> </p><p><span m='860000'>. Haldane in the mid-century, middle of the
  20th century wrote a</span> <span m='864000'>final exam to be given in the year
  2000 or so. And on the final exam</span> <span m='868000'>he had about 20 odd questions.
  And if you go through the exam</span> <span m='871000'>virtually all of those questions
  could indeed be answered by a</span> <span m='875000'>student in the year 2000,
  except for the question that says</span> <span m='879000'>consciousness arises on
  embryonic day 18, example.</span> </p><p><span m='883000'>And we have no progress
  toward that particular question.</span> </p><p><span m='886000'>That was one that
  he completely was way off in terms of being able to</span> <span m='890000'>predict
  that we'd make any progress on. Maybe he meant it as a joke.</span> </p><p><span
  m='894000'>Anyway. So, let's now dive into the specifics.</span> </p><p><span m='898000'>So,
  electrical signals in axons. Here is an axon. We're going to</span> <span m='904000'>give
  a very close up view. Here's the lipid bilayer. I'm just</span> <span m='910000'>going
  to take a cross-sectional view of my axon here.</span> </p><p><span m='916000'>That's
  the lipid bilayer. It turns out if I stick an</span> <span m='922000'>electrode
  into an axon and I measure the voltage gradient from the</span> <span m='928000'>outside
  of the cell to the inside of the cell, what I'm going to find is</span> <span m='934000'>that
  the inside of the cell is negative compared to the</span> <span m='940000'>outside
  of the cell. There is an electrical potential</span> <span m='945000'>across the
  plasma membrane of this axon. This plasma membrane you</span> <span m='950000'>remember,
  you know, you all remember about this.</span> </p><p><span m='955000'>This is, what,
  three nanometers wide. There's an electrical</span> <span m='960000'>membrane, electrical
  potential across this equal to about</span> <span m='965000'>minus 70 millivolts.</span>
  </p><p><span m='974000'>Now, come on, minus 70 millivolts is pretty trivial,</span>
  <span m='977000'>right? You go to the store, you buy a battery, what has it,</span>
  <span m='981000'>what's it got like one and a half volts or something?</span> </p><p><span
  m='984000'>It's minus 70 millivolts like who cares, right? Except it's minus 70</span>
  <span m='988000'>millivolts across three nanometers. What's the electrical field
  of minus</span> <span m='994000'>70 millivolts across the incredibly tiny distance
  of three nanometers?</span> </p><p><span m='1004000'>Well, the electrical field
  strength minus 70 millivolts over three</span> <span m='1013000'>nanometers is about
  200, 00 volts per centimeter.</span> </p><p><span m='1023000'>That's a very impressive
  number, 200,000 volts per centimeter.</span> </p><p><span m='1028000'>Suppose I
  could arrange to change the electrical potential of a cell</span> <span m='1033000'>from
  minus 70 millivolts inside to, I don't know, minus 70 millivolts</span> <span m='1038000'>outside.
  That would be a swing of 400,000 volts per centimeter.</span> </p><p><span m='1044000'>Do
  you think that a protein which had an alpha helix that had a dipole</span> <span
  m='1049000'>moment on it could feel a change of 400,000 volts per centimeter?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1055000'>You bet. Some alpha helix that had some dipole moment on
  it would swing</span> <span m='1059000'>wildly in the presence of a change of 400,000
  volts per centimeter.</span> </p><p><span m='1064000'>That's the key to how things
  work down there is this tiny little minus</span> <span m='1068000'>70 millivolts.
  It's a huge potential gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1073000'>And if we can change
  that we can swing the shapes of proteins</span> <span m='1077000'>quite dramatically.
  OK? That's the principle.</span> </p><p><span m='1082000'>Now, it turns out that
  if you take this electrode and use it to change</span> <span m='1088000'>the electrical
  gradient, what you will get is the following</span> <span m='1094000'>bizarre and
  fascinating behavior. So, take my axon here, I use this,</span> <span m='1099000'>and
  what I do is I start off, here's zero, at minus 70,</span> <span m='1105000'>minus
  70, this is the electrical potential.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>If I use the
  electrode to change this to about minus 50 or so then</span> <span m='1121000'>all
  by itself, with no further input on our part,</span> <span m='1131000'>the cell
  wildly shoots up to plus 50 before rapidly coming back down and</span> <span m='1141000'>reestablishing
  itself at minus 70. So, this depolarization slightly</span> <span m='1149000'>shifting
  it away from being as polar as it is, it has a polarity of minus</span> <span m='1155000'>70,
  if we depolarize it, make it less polar, make it less</span> <span m='1161000'>negative,
  all by itself the cell executes something called an action</span> <span m='1168000'>potential.
  This action potential involves rapidly changing to being</span> <span m='1174000'>positive
  inside the cell instead of negative and then restoring itself.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1181000'>And, as you would imagine, this massive change in the field has</span>
  <span m='1185000'>a huge effect on proteins in the membrane. This is called</span>
  <span m='1190000'>depolarization phase. Not shockingly this is the</span> <span
  m='1194000'>repolarization that occurs there afterwards. So,</span> <span m='1199000'>it
  goes from minus 70 millivolts up to about plus 50 millivolts there.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1204000'>All right. How does this happen? That's my job to explain right now.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1209000'>Well, the way this happens, what kind of a beautiful piece
  of</span> <span m='1214000'>engineering explains this? Well, the first thing you
  need to</span> <span m='1219000'>know is that there are some concentration gradients
  set up in</span> <span m='1224000'>the cell. So, the concentration gradients in
  the</span> <span m='1229000'>cell are as follows. There are certain ions,</span>
  <span m='1235000'>sodium. Sodium happens to be low inside the cell and high outside
  the</span> <span m='1242000'>cell. The concentration of sodium inside the cell is
  about 12</span> <span m='1249000'>millimolar. Whereas, outside the cell is about
  145</span> <span m='1256000'>millimolar. By contrast, potassium ions are high</span>
  <span m='1264000'>inside the cell, 139 millimolar. Whereas,</span> <span m='1272000'>only
  four millimolar on the outside of the cell. Calcium ions also have</span> <span
  m='1280000'>a gradient across the cell. They are virtually rare.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1288000'>0.1 micro, not milli, micromolar inside the cell and 2.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1293000'>millimolar outside the cell. So there are very big differences in</span>
  <span m='1298000'>the concentrations. Let me try to write these</span> <span m='1303000'>concentration
  gradients. If this is the outside and this is</span> <span m='1308000'>the inside,
  sodium has a concentration gradient higher on the</span> <span m='1313000'>outside
  than the inside. Potassium has a concentration</span> <span m='1318000'>gradient
  that's higher on the inside than the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='1323000'>Calcium
  has a concentration gradient higher on the outside than the</span> <span m='1327000'>inside.
  This turns out to be the force that drives this action</span> <span m='1332000'>potential,
  is that energy has been stored up in these concentration</span> <span m='1337000'>gradients.
  A concentration gradient is a form of energy.</span> </p><p><span m='1342000'>Why
  is that? Well, if there was no membrane there,</span> <span m='1347000'>what would
  be the concentration on the inside and the outside?</span> </p><p><span m='1352000'>The
  same. There wouldn't be an inside and outside but,</span> <span m='1355000'>you
  know, so let's imagine. Suppose I just drilled holes in the</span> <span m='1358000'>membrane.
  I get in there vrm, vrm, vrm, drill a lot of holes,</span> <span m='1361000'>it
  will equilibrate and, you know, because just by diffusion there,</span> <span m='1365000'>we'll
  go to the entropy, you know, entropy will set in and it</span> <span m='1368000'>will
  be equal concentrations. If I want to establish a</span> <span m='1371000'>concentration
  gradient then, I have to work against entropy.</span> </p><p><span m='1374000'>That
  takes energy here. And that is a form of energy then.</span> </p><p><span m='1378000'>I
  had to put work into moving ions around in order to establish a</span> <span m='1384000'>concentration
  gradient. Well, who's in charge of carrying</span> <span m='1390000'>out that work?
  Who is it that sets up these</span> <span m='1396000'>concentration gradients in
  the cell? Membrane proteins. Certain</span> <span m='1402000'>membrane proteins.
  In particular, membrane</span> <span m='1408000'>transporters are involved. So,
  we're going to talk about</span> <span m='1414000'>transporters and then we'll talk
  about some channels.</span> </p><p><span m='1420000'>All right. The first one.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1431000'>There is an ATP-driven sodium potassium pump.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1444000'>Any ideas what an ATP-driven sodium</span> <span m='1452000'>potassium
  pump does? It sets up, how does it set up a</span> <span m='1458000'>concentration
  gradient? So, what does it pump? It pumps a</span> <span m='1464000'>sodium. Does
  it pump a sodium in or out?</span> </p><p><span m='1469000'>It pumps a sodium out.
  It pumps potassium in. And it does it as an</span> <span m='1473000'>even exchange.
  Why would it like to do it as an</span> <span m='1477000'>even exchange, one sodium
  for one potassium?</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>Charge conservation, exactly.
  So, there's no electrical work to</span> <span m='1486000'>be done if it swaps them
  one for one. And is there work,</span> <span m='1490000'>though, to be done? Yes,
  there is, because if I'm going to</span> <span m='1494000'>pump sodium out of the
  cell, I'm doing it against the</span> <span m='1498000'>concentration gradient.
  Or at least once I get going I'm</span> <span m='1503000'>doing it against a concentration
  gradient. So,</span> <span m='1507000'>energy is needed to move a sodium out of
  the cell against its</span> <span m='1511000'>concentration gradient. Energy is
  also needed to move a</span> <span m='1515000'>potassium into the cell against its
  concentration gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1519000'>And where do we get the
  energy? ATP. So, an ATP is burned in order</span> <span m='1523000'>to do that.
  This guy gets called an anti-porter</span> <span m='1529000'>sometimes because it's
  an anti-transporter or something like</span> <span m='1536000'>that. OK. The pump
  then is ATPA as it uses the energy from an ATP to</span> <span m='1543000'>exchange
  this. Good. Next. There is an</span> <span m='1550000'>ATP-driven calcium pump or
  transporter.</span> </p><p><span m='1557000'>And, as you might imagine, what does
  it do? It transports a</span> <span m='1565000'>calcium ion out of the cell, and
  it happens not to do that in</span> <span m='1573000'>exchange for any other ion.
  And it, too, is driven by ATP.</span> </p><p><span m='1581000'>So, we go pump, pump,
  pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, pump, keep going.</span> </p><p><span m='1590000'>Will
  this thing be able to keep going forever,</span> <span m='1595000'>set up arbitrarily
  large concentration gradients? Why not?</span> </p><p><span m='1600000'>Well, what
  is nothing leaked back in?</span> </p><p><span m='1606000'>Could we, could we keep
  going? It gets harder and harder to put</span> <span m='1609000'>stuff out because
  you're working up against a bigger and bigger</span> <span m='1613000'>concentration
  gradient. And the ATP is only going to give</span> <span m='1616000'>you so much
  energy. So, at a certain point,</span> <span m='1619000'>the burning of that ATP
  or however many ATPs it uses for its specific</span> <span m='1623000'>mechanism
  won't suffice. So, there's going to be some natural</span> <span m='1626000'>upper
  bound to how far it could go in setting up a gradient because</span> <span m='1629000'>there's
  a nature amount of energy it can spend. OK.</span> </p><p><span m='1632000'>It's
  useful to think about these gradients as, you know,</span> <span m='1635000'>work
  that you've got to do and the hill gets steeper and steeper.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1639000'>All right. So that could, in principle, set the electrical</span> <span
  m='1642000'>gradient, the concentration change across the cell.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1645000'>But there's one other important component that we have</span> <span
  m='1648000'>to think about. And that is something called a</span> <span m='1654000'>resting
  potassium channel. So, what is a resting potassium</span> <span m='1662000'>channel?
  The resting potassium channel is a protein that sits in</span> <span m='1671000'>the
  membrane and it's got a hole in it, a pore.</span> </p><p><span m='1680000'>And
  that pore here is designed so that while a sodium can't escape</span> <span m='1684000'>through
  that pore, and you can imagine there's some</span> <span m='1689000'>little bit
  of cleaver molecular architecture to make the sodium atom</span> <span m='1693000'>not
  be able to, sodium ion not be able to get out</span> <span m='1698000'>but a potassium
  ion be able to get out, a potassium ion can get out.</span> </p><p><span m='1703000'>This
  is a completely open door that allows potassium ions to escape.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1707000'>Now, isn't this stupid? We just spent all this ATP getting</span> <span
  m='1712000'>potassium in and sodium out, and here I go opening the door for</span>
  <span m='1716000'>potassium saying you're free to leave despite all the work we
  put</span> <span m='1721000'>into bringing you into the cell. That makes no sense.
  All the</span> <span m='1725000'>potassium is just going to rush out.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1730000'>Can all the potassium rush out?</span> </p><p><span m='1738000'>The
  concentration gradient goes which way? It's more inside,</span> <span m='1742000'>more
  potassium inside, less outside, so the potassium is going to rush</span> <span m='1746000'>out.
  Yes. Ooh, electrical gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1750000'>If there's an electrical,
  so maybe at the beginning there's no</span> <span m='1755000'>electrical gradient,
  so potassium rushes out.</span> </p><p><span m='1759000'>What does it do? It makes
  it more positive on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='1763000'>Now the next potassium
  wants to rush out.</span> </p><p><span m='1768000'>It's going to, it's going down
  its concentration</span> <span m='1772000'>gradient but it's going up a teeny weenie
  little electrical gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1776000'>Now that gets out there,
  and what does it do to the outside?</span> </p><p><span m='1780000'>Makes it more
  positive. So, the third potassium makes it even</span> <span m='1785000'>more positive.
  And as more and more potassiums</span> <span m='1789000'>rush out, the outside becomes
  more positive. And every potassium now</span> <span m='1793000'>has to do work to
  get up that electrical gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>But, of course,
  it's still got a concentration</span> <span m='1802000'>gradient pushing it out.
  So, will they keep going forever?</span> </p><p><span m='1807000'>No, they're going
  to balance each other. There will come a point when</span> <span m='1811000'>the
  concentration gradient, the force driving potassium out due</span> <span m='1816000'>to
  the concentration gradient is offset by the electrical gradient</span> <span m='1820000'>pushing
  potassium in, or keeping potassium in.</span> </p><p><span m='1825000'>So, what
  happens is potassium goes out, rushes out,</span> <span m='1833000'>or goes out,
  leaks out, potassium leaks out which now sets</span> <span m='1841000'>up an electrical
  gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='1851000'>And what happens is the cell becomes more
  positive on the outside,</span> <span m='1856000'>more negative on the inside, and
  an equilibrium potential is reached,</span> <span m='1862000'>equilibrium is reached.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1869000'>So, an equilibrium electrical potential --</span> <span
  m='1872000'>-- is reached when the concentration</span> <span m='1882000'>gradient
  exactly offsets, when it balances the electrical</span> <span m='1890000'>gradient.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1899000'>Any guesses to what that electrical concentration gradient
  is?</span> </p><p><span m='1903000'>Minus 70 millivolts. That's where minus 70 millivolts
  comes from.</span> </p><p><span m='1908000'>It comes because that's the concentration
  gradient at which</span> <span m='1913000'>potassium going up that gradient just
  offsets the, yes?</span> </p><p><span m='1918000'>Well, because,</span> <span m='1931000'>oh,
  it doesn't. The electrical potential wants to</span> <span m='1934000'>keep it in.
  The concentration wants it out. The electrical wants it in.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1937000'>That's why we have an equilibrium. Exactly. It's those two balancing</span>
  <span m='1940000'>forces. Very good. So, how much potassium,</span> <span m='1943000'>by
  the way, has to rush out to set this up? It turns out</span> <span m='1946000'>a
  trivial amount. It turns out that about ten to,</span> <span m='1950000'>one part
  in ten to the sixth of all the potassium ions leaving sets up a</span> <span m='1954000'>gradient
  of about minus, of about five millivolts,</span> <span m='1959000'>minus five millivolts.
  One part in a million of the potassium ions will</span> <span m='1963000'>suffice
  to set up a concentration gradient of minus five millivolts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1968000'>So, all I've got to do is set up about, let's see,</span> <span m='1972000'>I
  don't know, less than, I don't know, maybe about one part</span> <span m='1977000'>in
  ten to the fifth of all the potassium ions leaving.</span> </p><p><span m='1982000'>A
  tiny contribution of the concentration.</span> </p><p><span m='1985000'>Changing
  the concentration by one part in ten to the fifth will get me</span> <span m='1988000'>minus
  50 millivolts already. So, what's very interesting is</span> <span m='1991000'>teeny
  amounts of ions set up a very big electrical gradient and have no</span> <span m='1995000'>real
  effect on the concentration, but they have a big effect on the</span> <span m='1998000'>electrical
  gradient. So, when I say potassium leaks out,</span> <span m='2001000'>it only takes
  a teeny bit of potassium to leak out in order to</span> <span m='2005000'>accomplish
  this. OK, guys. Now let's get ready to make an</span> <span m='2009000'>action potential.
  Here it goes. So,</span> <span m='2015000'>the action potential mechanism.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2025000'>We've set up our resting potential by transporters,</span>
  <span m='2031000'>by this open channel. Now, the first thing we have is a</span>
  <span m='2037000'>new kind of membrane channel. We have a voltage gated</span> <span
  m='2043000'>sodium channel.</span> </p><p><span m='2059000'>Check this out. This
  guy here is a channel that's</span> <span m='2066000'>closed. It's closed. Except,
  so at minus 70 millivolts</span> <span m='2075000'>it's closed. But if I can transiently
  depolarize the cell to</span> <span m='2085000'>minus 50 millivolts it opens and
  it admits sodium.</span> </p><p><span m='2096000'>So, when I get to minus 50 it
  opens. Now, what will sodium do when that</span> <span m='2104000'>door opens? Let's
  see. Electrically what would sodium,</span> <span m='2110000'>what would sodium
  do?</span> </p><p><span m='2120000'>So what, well, how about concentration?</span>
  </p><p><span m='2123000'>From the point of view of concentration what would sodium,</span>
  <span m='2126000'>oh, what did I just draw here? Ooh, forget my error.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2130000'>Electrically what would sodium like to do? It would like to come in,</span>
  <span m='2134000'>wouldn't it? Because it's negative inside and sodium is positive.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2138000'>But from a concentration gradient what would it like to
  do?</span> </p><p><span m='2142000'>Come in also. So what's stopping it? Nothing.
  We've got the ion</span> <span m='2146000'>that would like to come in electrically
  and would like to come</span> <span m='2150000'>in from the point of view of concentration.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2154000'>So what happens? It comes in. And it comes rushing</span>
  <span m='2158000'>in. Now, what happens as it comes</span> <span m='2162000'>rushing
  in? What will it do to our electrical potential?</span> </p><p><span m='2166000'>We
  went from minus 70, we got it transiently up to minus 50,</span> <span m='2171000'>and
  as it comes in what does it do to our electrical gradient?</span> </p><p><span m='2175000'>Brings
  in positive charge. The electrical gradient goes towards</span> <span m='2180000'>zero.
  Does it stop at zero? No, because now, even as the cell</span> <span m='2184000'>becomes
  positive in the interior, sodium still wants to keep coming in</span> <span m='2189000'>because
  of it's concentration gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='2194000'>It now has to do
  some work against the electrical gradient that's set</span> <span m='2199000'>up,
  but it keeps going and going and going. Does it go on forever?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2204000'>No, because eventually it reaches a point where the electrical gradient,</span>
  <span m='2209000'>positive now inside the cell, offsets the concentration gradient</span>
  <span m='2214000'>and it'll stop and it'll reach a new equilibrium potential which
  turns</span> <span m='2219000'>out to be at about plus 50. Amazing. Opens the door.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2224000'>Sodium comes rushing in down its concentration electrical
  gradient,</span> <span m='2228000'>shifts the electrical gradient from being negative
  to positive,</span> <span m='2233000'>and eventually it slows itself down because
  it's now going against an</span> <span m='2237000'>electrical gradient. But that's
  not the end of the story</span> <span m='2242000'>because what there also is, there
  are two other interesting</span> <span m='2247000'>functions. One, after a certain
  amount of time,</span> <span m='2251000'>after a very brief time interval --</span>
  <span m='2259000'>-- this channel also has the property that it closes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2262000'>So now when it closes,</span> <span m='2269000'>what's going to happen?
  The pumps will start working again</span> <span m='2273000'>and reestablish our
  negative 50. It's going to take too long, though.</span> </p><p><span m='2277000'>I
  mean it'll happen. You'd get back to minus 50,</span> <span m='2282000'>but it's
  going to take a long time. So it's good that the channels,</span> <span m='2286000'>that
  the voltage gated sodium channel closed,</span> <span m='2291000'>but even better
  nature has arranged to have a voltage gated</span> <span m='2295000'>potassium channel.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2305000'>And what happens to this voltage gated potassium channel
  is around</span> <span m='2311000'>plus 30 millivolts it opens and admits potassium.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2317000'>Now, instead of having to wait for the relatively slow
  ATP-driven pumps,</span> <span m='2325000'>what happens when I admit potassium?
  Well, if the cell is positive on</span> <span m='2333000'>the inside, negative on
  the outside, what happens to our potassium?</span> </p><p><span m='2341000'>Potassium
  starts coming out because there's more potassium on the inside</span> <span m='2348000'>and
  there's also a favorable electrical gradient.</span> </p><p><span m='2355000'>So,
  potassium explosively starts rushing out and rapidly</span> <span m='2362000'>reestablishes
  the resting potential. All this happening in a millisecond.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2370000'>It's very impressive. So, in something like one</span> <span m='2374000'>millisecond
  we open up the potassium channels. Now,</span> <span m='2378000'>you have to ask
  how did it happen that the channels got open in the</span> <span m='2382000'>first
  place? How did we get to minus 50? That's the work of these</span> <span m='2386000'>dendrites.
  The dendrites integrating a signal from all the</span> <span m='2391000'>things
  impacting on it will get the cell to minus 50,</span> <span m='2395000'>but once
  the cell gets to minus 50 at its axon hillock,</span> <span m='2399000'>bingo, the
  action potential fires, the cell zips up to plus 50 in a big</span> <span m='2403000'>rush
  of sodiums and then zips down to minus 70 again in a big rush of</span> <span m='2407000'>potassiums.
  Yes?</span> </p><p><span m='2416000'>Yup. Remember I said it was only like one part
  and ten to the fifth</span> <span m='2419000'>of the ions? It's a trivial actual,
  the number of ions necessary to set</span> <span m='2422000'>up these electrical
  things is such a tiny fraction of the concentration</span> <span m='2425000'>that
  through this whole thing those concentrations don't</span> <span m='2429000'>noticeably
  change. That's what's so cool,</span> <span m='2432000'>is there are different regimes,
  right? And they do change. They</span> <span m='2436000'>change by one part and
  ten to the fifth of those numbers.</span> </p><p><span m='2439000'>It's really cool,
  isn't it? We haven't screwed up our</span> <span m='2442000'>concentration gradient?
  We moved tiny numbers of ions to</span> <span m='2446000'>accomplish all this. This
  is very cleaver engineering.</span> </p><p><span m='2449000'>It's very cleaver engineering.
  Now, how do we manage to transmit this</span> <span m='2453000'>signal down a cell?
  Well, let's talk about how we</span> <span m='2456000'>propagate. I think this is
  really cool.</span> </p><p><span m='2460000'>This is one of the truly great mechanisms
  that was invented.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>Transmitting an action potential.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2479000'>Suppose I transmit my action. Suppose I have a neuron here
  and</span> <span m='2487000'>over here, at the axon hillock, I transiently depolarize
  to minus 50.</span> </p><p><span m='2495000'>Then I fire and fire.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2503000'>Well, what happens is this part of the cell was originally minus,</span>
  <span m='2509000'>minus, minus, plus, plus, plus, it becomes positive temporarily,</span>
  <span m='2515000'>right? It now becomes --</span> <span m='2524000'>-- plus, plus,
  plus. So, let's go minus along the</span> <span m='2530000'>whole cell here. Plus,
  plus, plus,</span> <span m='2536000'>plus, plus. Now, some little patch of membrane
  at the beginning of the</span> <span m='2543000'>axon has become positive inside,
  right? Because whatever local</span> <span m='2549000'>affect here caused this to
  flip. If this becomes positive at this</span> <span m='2555000'>part of the membrane,
  what happens to the negative charges</span> <span m='2560000'>over here a little
  bit further down the axon? Some of them will be</span> <span m='2566000'>pulled
  over to the positive. Ho-ho. Some negative charges get</span> <span m='2571000'>pulled
  over. Well, what happens when some of those</span> <span m='2576000'>negative charges
  get pulled over to my minus 70 millivolts?</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>Is it
  as negative as it was before? No. It becomes minus 50 millivolts.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2588000'>Oh. What happens when this becomes minus 50 millivolts?</span> </p><p><span
  m='2594000'>Fires an action potential. So, what happens is, here's my axon,</span>
  <span m='2601000'>I fire an action, I have an action potential here,</span> <span
  m='2607000'>and in the course of that I pull over some negative charge.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2614000'>That, of course, transiently depolarizes here and</span> <span m='2618000'>causes
  an action potential to fire. Then, of course, this becomes</span> <span m='2622000'>positive
  which pulls over some negative charge which causes the</span> <span m='2626000'>action
  potential to fire here, etc., etc., etc. So, if I can</span> <span m='2630000'>manage
  to get the thing started with my dendrites causing a transient</span> <span m='2635000'>depolarization
  from minus 70 to minus 50 then the action potential</span> <span m='2639000'>itself
  will draw over some charge and start the process at the next</span> <span m='2643000'>patch
  of membrane, the next patch of the next membrane,</span> <span m='2647000'>the next
  patch of the next membrane and the next patch of membrane.</span> </p><p><span m='2652000'>And
  it gets all the way down to the end. It's a brilliant mechanism.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2657000'>You can calculate, based on the diffusion coefficient of ions,</span>
  <span m='2662000'>how long it will take to transmit that signal. And it's OK</span>
  <span m='2668000'>but not good enough. I'd like it to go faster.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2673000'>How can I make it go faster?</span> </p><p><span m='2680000'>How about
  put an insulator around it? It turns out that with one little</span> <span m='2686000'>trick,
  I can speed this up dramatically. Oh,</span> <span m='2692000'>sorry. Sorry about
  that. The trick is suppose I were to wrap</span> <span m='2698000'>some insulator
  around the axon that would make this such that it could</span> <span m='2704000'>not,
  that it was not an electrical contract outside,</span> <span m='2710000'>that it
  was only an electric contact with the outside solution</span> <span m='2716000'>here,
  here, here. Then, when the action potential</span> <span m='2722000'>fires here,
  it's going to pull charges over, not from the tiny</span> <span m='2727000'>little
  patch of membrane here, but the charges are going to have to</span> <span m='2731000'>come
  from here, it turns out, because that's where</span> <span m='2736000'>I'm going
  to next feel my action potential. And so what'll happen is</span> <span m='2741000'>that
  the action potential, if this stuff is electrically</span> <span m='2745000'>insulated,
  will only be happening at this little gaps between the</span> <span m='2750000'>insulation.
  And I can dramatically speed up the electrical transmission</span> <span m='2755000'>if
  I'm willing to insulate the wire.</span> </p><p><span m='2760000'>Because then there's
  much less leakage along the way.</span> </p><p><span m='2764000'>So, it turns out
  that there are special cells that wrap themselves</span> <span m='2769000'>around
  the axon that are called Schwann cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2774000'>The Schwann
  cell wraps itself around and around and around and</span> <span m='2779000'>squeezes
  out all of its cytoplasm leaving only a lipid bilayer.</span> </p><p><span m='2784000'>Lipid
  bilayers wrapped around and around and around make</span> <span m='2789000'>great
  insulators. This is called the myelin sheath of</span> <span m='2795000'>a nerve.
  These myelin sheaths allow the transmission of this action</span> <span m='2801000'>potential
  to proceed about a hundred times faster. Very cleaver.</span> </p><p><span m='2808000'>Now
  you ask me how do I know this matters? I mean you can calculate</span> <span m='2814000'>that
  it should go about 100 times faster.</span> </p><p><span m='2821000'>But how would
  you really know that it mattered. Try taking them off.</span> </p><p><span m='2827000'>Unfortunately,
  there is a disease that takes them off.</span> </p><p><span m='2833000'>Some human
  patients make autoimmune reactions against their own myelin.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2840000'>It attacks their own myelin and leads to the demyelination</span> <span
  m='2846000'>of the nerves. This disease is called multiple</span> <span m='2852000'>sclerosis.
  Multiple sclerosis involves an autoimmune attack on</span> <span m='2858000'>your
  very own myelin sheaths, and the effects, the very serious</span> <span m='2864000'>effects
  that multiple sclerosis can have on an individual come from the</span> <span m='2870000'>greatly
  diminished, hundred-fold diminished conduction</span> <span m='2876000'>velocity
  of electrical signals down motor neurons along these</span> <span m='2882000'>large
  distances. So, this is, in fact,</span> <span m='2887000'>the basic electrical setup.
  We have taken a situation where we</span> <span m='2891000'>don't have electrical
  wires at all but have concocted,</span> <span m='2895000'>through chemistry, a powerful
  way to create signals.</span> </p><p><span m='2899000'>First, by setting up a resting
  potential using pumps and an open</span> <span m='2903000'>potassium channel. Then
  by setting up this explosive</span> <span m='2907000'>mechanism where a little change
  in voltage which,</span> <span m='2911000'>of course, has a huge change in field,
  swings open a sodium channel,</span> <span m='2916000'>shuts it, swings open a potassium
  channel, and then cleverly recruits</span> <span m='2920000'>charges from down the
  neuron and sends the signal.</span> </p><p><span m='2925000'>Next time we shall
  talk about what happens when the signal gets all the</span> <span m='2929000'>way
  to the other end and it has to talk to the next neuron.</span> </p><p><span m='2934000'>Till
  next time.</span> </p>
