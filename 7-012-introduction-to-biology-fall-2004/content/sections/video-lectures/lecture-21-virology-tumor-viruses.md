transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning class, nice to see you again.</span> </p><p><span
  m='5000'>I trust you had a relaxing weekend and a Happy Halloween,</span> <span
  m='10000'>whatever a Happy Halloween is. You recall that last time we were</span>
  <span m='15000'>talking about the process of cell transformation,</span> <span m='20000'>and
  recall, what I said was that transformation represents the</span> <span m='25000'>conversion
  of a normal cell into a cancer cell.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>In fact, there
  are a variety of traits of a cell which suggest it's</span> <span m='34000'>a cancer
  cell, it changes its shape,</span> <span m='38000'>it can get along with [foralized?
  growth factors. Normal cells</span> <span m='42000'>require tethering to the bottom
  of a Petri dish in order to grow.</span> </p><p><span m='47000'>Cancer cells, you
  can put them into a semi-solid medium,</span> <span m='51000'>like agar, and cancer
  cells will often grow like this,</span> <span m='55000'>as colonies in suspension,
  without direct tethering, without</span> <span m='59000'>direct adhesion to a solid,
  underlying substrate.</span> </p><p><span m='64000'>And that, that's a trait of
  cancer cells, the phenotype of cancer cells,</span> <span m='68000'>is sometimes
  called, anchorage independence.</span> </p><p><span m='72000'>But ultimately, the
  best litmus test, whether a cell is truly</span> <span m='76000'>transformed, is
  tumoraganisity, i.e. the ability of a cell, when</span> <span m='81000'>plucked
  out of a Petri-dish like this, and implanted into a host</span> <span m='85000'>mouse,
  to actually grow into a tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>So there are various
  gradations of becoming transformed,</span> <span m='94000'>but tumoraganisity is
  the ultimate arbiter of whether or not a cell is</span> <span m='98000'>truly transformed.
  Now, you'll recall from our</span> <span m='102000'>conversation last time that
  if you put a transformed cell,</span> <span m='106000'>a mixed a mono-layer of normal
  cells, that the transformed cell will</span> <span m='110000'>overgrow the mono-layer,
  it will have lost contact inhibition,</span> <span m='114000'>and that when viewed
  from above, such a Petri-dish yields a thick</span> <span m='118000'>clump of cells,
  which is called a focus,</span> <span m='122000'>plural, foci. And I will tell you
  that beginning</span> <span m='126000'>in the late 1960's, one began to use a variety
  of</span> <span m='130000'>different techniques, with which to transform cancer
  cells</span> <span m='134000'>into normal cells. One of the techniques one used
  was</span> <span m='138000'>to apply chemical carcinogens to cells, and keep in
  mind that we're</span> <span m='143000'>reserving the word, carcinogen, for a chemical
  or a</span> <span m='147000'>physical agent that causes cancer. Ultraviolet radiation
  is a</span> <span m='151000'>carcinogen, as are x-rays, and there are many chemical</span>
  <span m='155000'>carcinogens, such as those in tobacco smoke.</span> </p><p><span
  m='160000'>And certain experiments in the early 1970's began to reveal that one</span>
  <span m='164000'>could get foci of transformed cells, by applying chemical carcinogen
  to</span> <span m='169000'>the cell in-vitro, and when I say in-vitro,</span> <span
  m='173000'>I mean growing here, in the Petri dish. And, in fact,</span> <span m='178000'>one
  could begin to use a whole variety of different types of</span> <span m='182000'>carcinogens,
  chemical carcinogens, and what seemed to be shared in</span> <span m='187000'>common
  between all these carcinogens was that they were all mutagenic.</span> </p><p><span
  m='192000'>By mutagenic, I clearly mean the ability to inflict damage on the</span>
  <span m='196000'>genome of the cells that were being exposed to these various compounds.</span>
  </p><p><span m='200000'>In fact, one could draw an interesting correlation because
  many</span> <span m='204000'>of these mutagenic compounds had, also by chance, been
  tested in</span> <span m='209000'>laboratory animals for their carcinogenicity.</span>
  </p><p><span m='213000'>And so plots were derived in the mid-1970's, between the
  mutagenic</span> <span m='217000'>potential of a compound, and the carcinogenic
  potential of a</span> <span m='221000'>compound. And when I say a carcinogen,</span>
  <span m='225000'>how carcinogenic is a compound, I mean, how many milligrams of
  this</span> <span m='229000'>compound does it take to make a tumor? And so,</span>
  <span m='233000'>what one could do, is plot over a log-log scale,</span> <span m='237000'>how
  many milligrams of a given compound was required,</span> <span m='240000'>or micrograms,
  to make a tumor in a rat or a mouse.</span> </p><p><span m='244000'>And, at the
  same time, how mutagenic were these compounds,</span> <span m='248000'>i.e. how
  potent were they in their ability to inflict damage</span> <span m='252000'>on the
  genome? Because it turns out,</span> <span m='256000'>that if this log-log scale
  is by orders of magnitude,</span> <span m='260000'>powers of ten, compounds range
  over at least five or six orders of</span> <span m='264000'>magnitude in their potency
  in inflicting mutations,</span> <span m='269000'>and similarly, in their potency
  in inducing tumors in mice and rats.</span> </p><p><span m='273000'>And what one
  found was the following, that there was a log-log</span> <span m='277000'>relationship
  that was roughly linear, but there was violations to this.</span> </p><p><span m='282000'>Some
  compounds were extraordinarily mutagenic, they could create</span> <span m='286000'>mutations
  in very low doses, and at the same time could create</span> <span m='290000'>tumors,
  they were carcinogenic in very low doses.</span> </p><p><span m='295000'>Other compounds
  required an enormous amount of material in order to</span> <span m='299000'>induce
  mutations on the abscissa, and an enormous amount of material</span> <span m='304000'>in
  order to induce tumors on the ordinate. And this log-log</span> <span m='308000'>relationship
  over five orders of magnitude, suggested the following</span> <span m='313000'>obvious
  idea, that carcinogens are mutagenic, and to the extent that</span> <span m='318000'>carcinogens
  are able to induce cancer, they do so through their</span> <span m='322000'>ability
  to inflict mutational damage on the cells within certain</span> <span m='327000'>target
  tissues. And this, therefore,</span> <span m='332000'>obviously suggested the notion
  that within cancer cells,</span> <span m='336000'>as we said last time, there are
  mutant genes,</span> <span m='341000'>and that these mutant genes are moreover instrumental
  in conferring</span> <span m='346000'>the transformed phenotype on the cells that
  carry these mutant genes.</span> </p><p><span m='350000'>In the, in the late 1960's
  and early 1970's, a man named Howard</span> <span m='355000'>Temin, began to use
  a virus called Rous sarcoma virus,</span> <span m='360000'>which had first been
  discovered in 1909 by a man named Peyton Rous.</span> </p><p><span m='365000'>Rous
  was then a professor at the Rockefeller Institute,</span> <span m='369000'>later
  the Rockefeller University, in New York. A Long Island chicken</span> <span m='373000'>farmer
  brought in a prized hen of his who had been growing a big</span> <span m='377000'>muscle
  tumor, or sarcoma, in her breast muscle, and asked Rous,</span> <span m='381000'>the
  famous chicken doctor, if he could cure this chicken,</span> <span m='385000'>and
  Rous said, thank you, cut off the hen's head,</span> <span m='389000'>extracted
  the tumor, and ground up the tumor,</span> <span m='393000'>and after having homogenized
  the tumor, passed the homogenate</span> <span m='397000'>through a filter. And this
  filter would trap all</span> <span m='402000'>cellular material, but it would allow
  non-cellular</span> <span m='406000'>material, or material that was smaller than
  the size of a cell,</span> <span m='410000'>to pass right through. And so, therefore,
  Rous took the material</span> <span m='414000'>that passed through the filter, which
  you can call the filtrate,</span> <span m='418000'>and he injected the filtrate,
  which passed through the filter,</span> <span m='423000'>into a young chick. And
  what he observed thereafter was that chick</span> <span m='427000'>soon came down
  with sarcoma after a period of some months,</span> <span m='431000'>and when he
  ground up the tumor in that chick, and once again injected</span> <span m='435000'>into
  another chick, he once again got a tumor.</span> </p><p><span m='440000'>The fact
  that the agent, which was inducing the cancer,</span> <span m='444000'>and could
  be transmitted from one animal to another,</span> <span m='448000'>from one chicken
  to the other, was filterable, suggested it was</span> <span m='452000'>extremely
  small, and at the time one had already</span> <span m='456000'>begun to appreciate
  the fact that there were sub-cellular infectious</span> <span m='460000'>agents,
  which we now call viruses. And Peyton Rous made this very</span> <span m='464000'>important
  discovery in 1909, 1910, and in 1965 he was awarded a</span> <span m='468000'>Nobel
  Prize for this. It's a rather long wait,</span> <span m='472000'>wouldn't you say?
  So he only had to wait 55 years,</span> <span m='476000'>anyhow, he died a happy
  man, we can only presume. Now, what's</span> <span m='480000'>interesting about
  this is the life cycle of Rous Sarcoma virus.</span> </p><p><span m='484000'>As
  we will discuss in greater detail later, viruses are</span> <span m='488000'>sub-cellular
  particles, they don't have their own energy</span> <span m='492000'>metabolism,
  and they parasitize on the macromolecular machinery of the</span> <span m='496000'>cell
  that they infect. And therefore, what we can imagine</span> <span m='500000'>here
  is the following scenario, which actually happens to be true.</span> </p><p><span
  m='505000'>A virus particle, which is vastly smaller than a cell,</span> <span m='509000'>enters
  the cell, the virus particle carries into the cell its own genome,</span> <span
  m='514000'>and this genome, in this case of Rous Sarcoma virus,</span> <span m='518000'>is
  single-stranded RNA, and this genome, which is carried into the</span> <span m='523000'>cell,
  carries the information for making more virus particles.</span> </p><p><span m='527000'>And
  what happens is, in the case of Rous Sarcoma virus,</span> <span m='532000'>as Temin
  later speculated in a speculation that caused him ridicule</span> <span m='536000'>and
  ostracism for many years, that the single-stranded RNA of Rous</span> <span m='541000'>Sarcoma
  virus, once it gets into the cell,</span> <span m='545000'>is reverse-transcribe,
  i.e. copied into DNA molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='550000'>So now we have double-stranded
  DNA, a double-stranded DNA copy of the</span> <span m='555000'>viral genome, and
  this double-stranded DNA molecule,</span> <span m='560000'>which came to be called
  a pro-virus, then became integrated into the host</span> <span m='565000'>chromosomal
  DNA. So here's the host-chromosome.</span> </p><p><span m='570000'>And now, the
  pro-virus, which I'll depict here in the middle,</span> <span m='576000'>in white,
  became physically inserted as a double-stranded DNA molecule,</span> <span m='581000'>it
  was slipped right into the genome. We now realize that any,</span> <span m='586000'>any
  of tens, of hundreds, of millions of different sites in</span> <span m='590000'>the
  genome of the host cell. And this pro-virus, once</span> <span m='594000'>established
  or integrated into the genome, could thereafter,</span> <span m='598000'>function
  essentially like a cellular gene, i.e. from a</span> <span m='602000'>molecular-biological
  perspective, it was indistinguishable from a</span> <span m='606000'>cellular gene,
  it was double-stranded DNA,</span> <span m='610000'>it had a promoter it carried
  in a promoter with it,</span> <span m='614000'>and it had a polyadenylation signal,
  and therefore, this pro-virus</span> <span m='618000'>thereafter, could use, or
  parasitize, the host-cell RNA</span> <span m='622000'>polymerase 2, to make viral
  messenger RNA,</span> <span m='626000'>on the one hand, and progeny-genomic RNA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='630000'>Now when I say genomic, I'm not talking about the host-cell</span>
  <span m='634000'>genome, I'm talking about the viral genome. How big is the virus?</span>
  </p><p><span m='638000'>Well, it's about nine or ten kilo-bases in length,</span>
  <span m='642000'>so it's genome, obviously, is vastly smaller than the 3.</span>
  </p><p><span m='646000'>mega- bases that constitute the haploid human genome.</span>
  </p><p><span m='651000'>The viral mRNA, once transcribed in the nucleus, and exported
  to the</span> <span m='655000'>cytoplasm, could make viral proteins, and the viral
  proteins could then be</span> <span m='659000'>used to encapsidate, and when I use
  the word encapsidate,</span> <span m='663000'>keep in mind, I never use a simple
  word when a polysyllabic</span> <span m='667000'>one is possible. So when I, when
  the viral proteins</span> <span m='672000'>encapsidate the viral-RNA, you get a
  virus particle like this,</span> <span m='676000'>which has virus proteins on the
  outside, almost on the outside,</span> <span m='681000'>viral RNA in the middle,
  single-stranded RNA,</span> <span m='685000'>and this single-stranded RNA comes
  from the transcription of the</span> <span m='690000'>pro-virus that has now been
  integrated into the genome.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>Integration is an important
  concept here, i.e. it becomes</span> <span m='699000'>covalently linked. And this
  suggests to us that the</span> <span m='704000'>virus actually encodes several specialized
  proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='708000'>One set of specialized proteins is required
  for the</span> <span m='712000'>reverse-transcription, and in fact, the virus actually</span>
  <span m='716000'>carries with it, into the cell, not only its RNA,</span> <span
  m='720000'>but also, reverse transcriptase. So if you isolate the virus particle,</span>
  <span m='724000'>it has, in addition to this coat, it has within it already reversed</span>
  <span m='728000'>transcriptase, molecules, so that the moment that</span> <span
  m='732000'>this virion, a virion is a virus-particle.</span> </p><p><span m='736000'>The
  moment that this virion, or virus-particle, penetrates into</span> <span m='739000'>the
  cytoplasm of the cell, there is then, immediately,</span> <span m='742000'>an abundant
  supply of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates,</span> <span m='746000'>the process
  of reverse-transcription can begin, the double-stranded DNA</span> <span m='749000'>can
  be produced, exported to the cytoplasm,</span> <span m='753000'>where a second viral
  protein is responsible for integrating the</span> <span m='756000'>resulting double-stranded
  reverse transcript into the</span> <span m='760000'>host-cell genome. Again, that's
  a highly specialized</span> <span m='764000'>function. The forward transcription,
  we just talked about</span> <span m='768000'>reverse-transcription, but the forward-transcription
  to</span> <span m='772000'>make progeny RNA, obviously can rely on the host cell</span>
  <span m='776000'>polymerase, the virus doesn't need to make that. The viral mRNA
  can be</span> <span m='780000'>translated by host cell ribosomes in the cytoplasm,</span>
  <span m='784000'>the virus doesn't need to make that. Some of the viral aren't,
  the new</span> <span m='788000'>viral RNA, is genomic RNA, which as I say, becomes
  encapsidated</span> <span m='792000'>to make progeny virus particles. And a cell,
  which is infected in</span> <span m='795000'>this way, can suffer two fates. It
  could be, as is in the case with</span> <span m='799000'>many viruses like this,
  that the viruses, that the cell is</span> <span m='803000'>not actually killed by
  this infection, i.e.</span> </p><p><span m='807000'>that the cell can tolerate an
  infectious, an infection like this,</span> <span m='810000'>and therefore, if you
  look at such a cell, for days and weeks later,</span> <span m='814000'>it will be
  producing virus particles, which are being released from the</span> <span m='818000'>cell,
  continuously, continually released from the cell,</span> <span m='822000'>and are
  able then, to pass and infect yet other cells.</span> </p><p><span m='826000'>The
  alternative to this is what is called a cytopathic effect,</span> <span m='829000'>and
  the truth of the matter is, many kinds of viruses, when they go</span> <span m='833000'>and
  infect a cell, and they produce their progeny,</span> <span m='837000'>they end
  up killing the cell that they've infected.</span> </p><p><span m='841000'>So, for
  example, when we get infected by a cold virus,</span> <span m='844000'>which has
  a different metabolism than this one,</span> <span m='848000'>by the way, then the
  cells that are infected and produce progeny-virus</span> <span m='852000'>particles
  are rather quickly killed, as a consequence of the infection,</span> <span m='856000'>which
  is why we have damage to our nasal mucosa.</span> </p><p><span m='860000'>But in
  this case, in the case of Temin's virus,</span> <span m='864000'>actually RSV, Rous
  Sarcoma Virus, that isn't the case. And therefore,</span> <span m='869000'>in fact,
  one has RSV particles that are continually being released from</span> <span m='873000'>the
  cell. If one looks under the electron microscope,</span> <span m='878000'>at the
  surface of a virus-infected cell, one sees structures like this.</span> </p><p><span
  m='883000'>Where here is in the green is the lipid by-layer,</span> <span m='887000'>the
  plasma membrane of the cell. And here, in the middle,</span> <span m='891000'>is
  a viral-protein capsid, a protein capsid like this,</span> <span m='895000'>encoded
  by the virus, and carried in the capsid is actually,</span> <span m='898000'>are
  actually, the viral-RNA molecules, and the</span> <span m='901000'>reverse-transcriptase
  molecule. And in saying that, what I mean to</span> <span m='905000'>suggest to
  you, is that actually the viral particle,</span> <span m='908000'>the virion, is
  slightly more complicated than I represented</span> <span m='912000'>it to be. As
  the virus, as progeny particles</span> <span m='915000'>are made, they are pushed
  out through the plasma membrane of the</span> <span m='919000'>infected cell, on
  which occasion,</span> <span m='923000'>they become enveloped with a layer of plasma
  membrane.</span> </p><p><span m='926000'>And this layer of plasma membrane is actually
  stolen as a patch from</span> <span m='930000'>the plasma membrane of the infected
  cell. So in truth,</span> <span m='934000'>actually, a virus particle like RSV,
  has some membrane around it, it has</span> <span m='937000'>a protein-capsid encoded
  by the viral mRNA, and in the middle it has</span> <span m='941000'>RNA and reverse
  transcriptase molecules.</span> </p><p><span m='945000'>Note, by the way, that most
  viruses actually,</span> <span m='949000'>everything that the virus carries, the
  virus has encoded in it's own</span> <span m='953000'>genome, in this case, the
  virus has stolen, has absconded,</span> <span m='957000'>with a patch of plasma
  membrane from the infected cell.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>Now what Temin observered,
  several other people before him had</span> <span m='966000'>done so, was that when
  he infected a mono-layer of chicken cells with</span> <span m='970000'>Rous Sarcoma
  virus, he was able to in fact,</span> <span m='975000'>observe the appearance of
  foci of transformed cells.</span> </p><p><span m='979000'>And he observed that these
  foci of transformed cells actually released</span> <span m='983000'>Rous Sarcoma
  Virus. So, the infection by Rous Sarcoma</span> <span m='987000'>Virus, had led
  to the production of progeny virus particles,</span> <span m='991000'>which we kind
  of expect of a virus. Keep in mind that if a virus can't</span> <span m='995000'>produce
  progeny, it's out of business.</span> </p><p><span m='999000'>Or, to put it another
  way, the only thing a virus is really</span> <span m='1002000'>interested in, is
  making more copies of itself.</span> </p><p><span m='1006000'>So, the cells in these
  foci of transformants were transformed,</span> <span m='1010000'>but they were also
  releasing progeny virus particles.</span> </p><p><span m='1014000'>And if you took
  these virus particles, and he could isolate them</span> <span m='1017000'>away from
  any contaminating cell, the way Peyton Rous did, just by</span> <span m='1021000'>filtering
  them, or the filter will trap all of the</span> <span m='1024000'>cells, and allow
  the much tinier virus particles to pass through,</span> <span m='1028000'>then he
  could take these virus particles and infect another plate</span> <span m='1031000'>of
  cells, and once again, he would get foci of transformants.</span> </p><p><span m='1035000'>And
  therefore, this virus was actually bipotential, it</span> <span m='1039000'>could
  do two things. It could replicate,</span> <span m='1042000'>here I've been talking
  about the life cycle or the replication-cycle</span> <span m='1046000'>of the virus,
  on the one hand, and on the other hand, it could</span> <span m='1049000'>transform
  cells. And subsequent work demonstrated</span> <span m='1052000'>that actually,
  the replicated functions of Rous</span> <span m='1056000'>Sarcoma Virus, on the
  one hand,</span> <span m='1059000'>and the transforming functions of Rous Sarcoma
  Virus,</span> <span m='1063000'>on the other hand, were encoded in separable genes.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1066000'>For example, Howard Temin was able to demonstrate,</span>
  <span m='1069000'>and others later, that one could get mutants of RSV</span> <span
  m='1073000'>that had lost the ability to transform cells,</span> <span m='1076000'>but
  could still replicate perfectly well.</span> </p><p><span m='1080000'>And there
  were yet other mutants that had lost the ability to</span> <span m='1083000'>replicate,
  but could transform perfectly well.</span> </p><p><span m='1087000'>And so there
  were two classes of specialized genes,</span> <span m='1091000'>one involved in
  replication, the other in transformation. In</span> <span m='1095000'>1975 and 1976,
  the laboratories of Harold Varmus</span> <span m='1098000'>and Mike Bishop, at University
  of California,</span> <span m='1102000'>San Francisco, or UCSF, as it's called in
  the trade,</span> <span m='1106000'>began to exam the origin of the viral transforming
  gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1110000'>Now the viral transforming gene, because it
  was assumed there was</span> <span m='1114000'>only one of them, the genome is so
  small,</span> <span m='1118000'>it only has about ten kilo-basis, and only enough
  room for three, or</span> <span m='1122000'>four, or five, genes in it, not a hundred
  or a</span> <span m='1126000'>thousand, the viral transforming gene came to be called
  SRC,</span> <span m='1130000'>S-R-C. And what they observed was the following,</span>
  <span m='1134000'>they made a radio-labeled probe, which was specific for the SRC
  gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1138000'>And they could use the radio-labeled</span>
  <span m='1142000'>probe to anneal to two kinds of viruses, wild-type Rous Sarcoma</span>
  <span m='1148000'>Virus, and a deletion mutant, I'll use the Greek -delta, a version</span>
  <span m='1154000'>of Rous Sarcoma Virus, which was lacking, which apparently</span>
  <span m='1160000'>through process of genetic deletion, was lacking the ability to
  transform</span> <span m='1166000'>cells. And that loss of ability to transform
  cells was ostensibly due</span> <span m='1172000'>to the lesion of it's genome of
  the SRC gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1178000'>And what they observed is that the
  SRC, the radio-labeled SRC probe,</span> <span m='1181000'>as one would've hoped,
  was able to anneal to this wild-type genome,</span> <span m='1185000'>but it couldn't
  anneal to the deletion mutant of RSV,</span> <span m='1189000'>which had lost the
  SRC gene through a process of genetic deletion.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>So,
  so far, so good. By the way, the fact that the SRC gene could</span> <span m='1196000'>transform
  cells, led to it's being called,</span> <span m='1200000'>an oncogene. The term
  "oncos" in Greek means, a tumor or a lump,</span> <span m='1204000'>an oncogene
  therefore, was a cancer-causing gene.</span> </p><p><span m='1208000'>And therefore,
  Rous Sarcoma Virus possessed at</span> <span m='1211000'>least one cancer-causing
  gene, or oncogene. Now the mind-blowing</span> <span m='1215000'>result that happened
  shortly thereafter, was the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1219000'>People in
  the Varmus-Bishop lab began to look for the origins of the</span> <span m='1222000'>SRC
  oncogene of Rous Sarcoma Virus. It turns out that the vast majority</span> <span
  m='1226000'>of genes that have been in virus, that are present in viral genomes,</span>
  <span m='1230000'>have been in viral genomes, as far as we know, for the last</span>
  <span m='1234000'>billion years. i.e. we have every reason to think</span> <span
  m='1238000'>that the evolutionary origins of viruses can be traced into the</span>
  <span m='1242000'>distant past. It could even be the case, some people think,</span>
  <span m='1246000'>some perfectly sane people think, that this whole retro-virus
  life</span> <span m='1250000'>cycle that I just told you about, recapitulates one
  of the earliest</span> <span m='1255000'>stages of cellular evolution on the planet.
  People believe now,</span> <span m='1259000'>with ever-increasing conviction, and
  keep in mind, class, people who</span> <span m='1263000'>are convinced of something
  are usually wrong, in a loud voice.</span> </p><p><span m='1268000'>But people believe
  with ever-increasing conviction,</span> <span m='1271000'>that the first cells on
  earth actually had RNA genomes,</span> <span m='1275000'>rather than DNA genomes,
  and that the invention of double-stranded DNA</span> <span m='1279000'>genomes in
  cellular life forms, came later. And if it did, then the</span> <span m='1283000'>conversion
  from an RNA to a DNA state is reflected in the modern</span> <span m='1286000'>life
  cycle of Rous Sarcoma Virus, and similar viruses, which as you</span> <span m='1290000'>may
  know, have come to be called retroviruses, simply because they</span> <span m='1294000'>transcribe
  their nucleic acid backwards.</span> </p><p><span m='1298000'>So, Varmus and Bishop
  were interested in the origins of the SRC</span> <span m='1301000'>oncogene that
  was carried by Rous Sarcoma Virus.</span> </p><p><span m='1305000'>I say, well it
  probably, the Rous Sarcoma Virus, had</span> <span m='1309000'>antecedents, which
  existed thousands and millions of years ago,</span> <span m='1313000'>and carried
  the SRC oncogene. But the fact of the matter is,</span> <span m='1316000'>the SRC,
  the Rous Sarcoma Virus, had only been isolated once in the</span> <span m='1320000'>20th
  century, when this very trusting, and caring,</span> <span m='1324000'>Long Island
  chicken farmer came in to Peyton Rous,</span> <span m='1328000'>hoping that Rous
  would cure his chicken, rather than cutting the</span> <span m='1332000'>chicken's
  head off. So what happened,</span> <span m='1336000'>then, was the following. They
  used this radiolabeled probe</span> <span m='1341000'>to look at the DNA of infected,
  RSV-infected chicken cells, and</span> <span m='1346000'>uninfected chicken cells.
  So they probed the DNA of the</span> <span m='1350000'>infected chicken cells, with
  this radiolabeled probe,</span> <span m='1355000'>and they probed the DNA with uninfected
  chicken cell,</span> <span m='1360000'>of uninfected chicken cells, once again with
  this radiolabeled</span> <span m='1365000'>probe. And what they,</span> <span m='1369000'>what
  they expected to find was the following, it's obvious,</span> <span m='1372000'>in
  uninfected chicken cells you don't find any SRC,</span> <span m='1375000'>and in
  infected chicken cells, you do find SRC, because the SRC</span> <span m='1379000'>gene
  has been brought into the infected cells by the infecting</span> <span m='1382000'>viral
  genome. Stands to reason, right? Shouldn't be any in the</span> <span m='1385000'>uninfected
  cells, after the cell's infected,</span> <span m='1388000'>now they have a SRC,
  at least one copy, they may have multiple copies</span> <span m='1391000'>of the
  SRC oncogene, because I haven't really dictated</span> <span m='1395000'>how many
  pro-viruses should be integrated into the genome</span> <span m='1398000'>of an
  infected cell. And what they found was puzzling,</span> <span m='1402000'>and eventually
  mind-blowing. Because they found that in the DNA</span> <span m='1407000'>of uninfected
  chicken cells, they could find a SRC gene, and</span> <span m='1413000'>these uninfected
  chicken cells had never experienced Rous Sarcoma Virus</span> <span m='1418000'>in
  any form, whatsoever. And as a consequence, they began to</span> <span m='1423000'>develop
  a theory, a model, which turned out,</span> <span m='1428000'>actually, to be right
  on, and the model was as follows,</span> <span m='1434000'>that there was a retrovirus,
  like Rous Sarcoma Virus, that was</span> <span m='1439000'>the precursor of RSV,
  and this retrovirus had replication</span> <span m='1444000'>genes, but it lacked
  a transforming oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='1450000'>This retrovirus went into
  a chicken cell, and when it emerged from the</span> <span m='1454000'>chicken cell,
  it carried not only the replication genes,</span> <span m='1458000'>but now the
  SRC oncogene. It had acquired a new gene,</span> <span m='1462000'>which it could
  then use to subsequently transform other cells</span> <span m='1466000'>that it
  had infected. And this, itself, turned out to be</span> <span m='1470000'>absolutely
  right. This SRC gene was of cellular</span> <span m='1474000'>origin, and in fact,
  homologs of the SRC gene,</span> <span m='1478000'>were present in all vertebrates,
  in all chordates, in all metazoan,</span> <span m='1482000'>there's even a distant
  homolog of the SRC gene that's present in</span> <span m='1486000'>sponge cells,
  which are obviously rather primitive.</span> </p><p><span m='1490000'>So this SRC
  gene is not a recent invention, it's been sitting around</span> <span m='1494000'>in
  the eukaryotic genome, at least in the genome of metazoan</span> <span m='1498000'>and
  its precursors, for a very long time.</span> </p><p><span m='1502000'>It was kidnapped,
  picked up by the Rous Sarcoma Virus,</span> <span m='1507000'>and subsequently exploited
  by the virus to transform cells that it</span> <span m='1511000'>happened to infect.
  And this acquisition and activation</span> <span m='1515000'>of a gene was obviously
  a rare event, because RSV, as I've just told you,</span> <span m='1519000'>was only
  picked up once, was only generated once.</span> </p><p><span m='1524000'>It didn't
  exist in nature, and Rous Sarcoma Virus was never</span> <span m='1528000'>seen
  to, go from one chicken flock to the other, like most infectious</span> <span m='1532000'>agents.
  The ecology of Rous Sarcoma Virus is not so much of interest to</span> <span m='1536000'>us,
  what is of greatest interest to us in our discussion today,</span> <span m='1541000'>is
  the following notion that, within the normal genome of a</span> <span m='1545000'>chicken
  cell, there exists a normal gene which came to be called a</span> <span m='1549000'>proto-oncogene,
  a precursor of the,</span> <span m='1554000'>A proto-oncogene which resides in normal
  chicken DNA,</span> <span m='1558000'>and the fact that the proto-oncogene is highly
  conserved,</span> <span m='1562000'>evolutionary, dictates to us that this proto-oncogene,</span>
  <span m='1566000'>this SRC proto-oncogene, must mediate essential functions,</span>
  <span m='1570000'>otherwise it wouldn't long ago been lost. In fact,</span> <span
  m='1574000'>just to repeat myself, virtually identical copies of the</span> <span
  m='1578000'>SRC oncogene, proto-oncogene, excuse me, lie, can be found in the</span>
  <span m='1582000'>genomes of all vertebrates. So, a proto-oncogene is a normal</span>
  <span m='1586000'>cellular, growth-regulating gene, which, on this occasion, became</span>
  <span m='1590000'>activated, and subverted, and converted into an active</span>
  <span m='1594000'>transforming gene, i.e. an oncogene. So the term</span> <span
  m='1599000'>-proto in this case, implies a normal gene,</span> <span m='1603000'>which
  has the potential, under certain circumstances,</span> <span m='1607000'>to become
  an active oncogene. In the years that followed,</span> <span m='1611000'>it's been
  almost 30 years now, more than 30 proto-oncogenes have</span> <span m='1615000'>been
  discovered, by looking at retroviruses like RSV.</span> </p><p><span m='1618000'>SRC
  is not the only proto-oncogene that lies in our genome,</span> <span m='1622000'>and
  therefore, we begin to appreciate on the basis of this,</span> <span m='1625000'>that
  our genome carries a whole repertoire of these</span> <span m='1629000'>growth-regulating
  genes that, when a retrovirus happens to swoop</span> <span m='1633000'>in, can
  be activated into active oncogenes, they can be converted</span> <span m='1636000'>into
  active oncogenes, and thereafter, they can induce</span> <span m='1640000'>cancer.
  And this obviously leads to the</span> <span m='1644000'>suggestion that the seeds
  of human cancer don't lie,</span> <span m='1648000'>necessarily, on the outside
  of cells because most kinds of human cancers</span> <span m='1653000'>are not caused
  by infecting viruses. That was a puzzle that was already</span> <span m='1658000'>apparent
  in the late-1970's. If Rous Sarcoma Virus, or similar</span> <span m='1662000'>viruses,
  could not be invoked to explain many kinds of viruses,</span> <span m='1667000'>how
  could one get cancer? And this work suggested an obvious solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1672000'>Let's imagine that there are a repertoire of a dozen,</span> <span m='1675000'>or
  two-dozen, or three-dozen, proto-oncogenes that reside in our</span> <span m='1678000'>normal
  genome, their purpose there is not to create</span> <span m='1681000'>cancer, their
  purpose is to regulate normal cell proliferation.</span> </p><p><span m='1685000'>These
  genes, being genes, are subject to damage,</span> <span m='1688000'>to mutation,
  and therefore we can imagine that in cases of human</span> <span m='1691000'>cancer,
  where there are no viruses involved, there can be genetic</span> <span m='1695000'>alteration
  of the DNA sequences of a proto-oncogene that converted</span> <span m='1698000'>into
  an oncogene. i.e chemical changes to the DNA,</span> <span m='1702000'>mutagenic
  changes to the DNA, can mimic the conversion of a</span> <span m='1707000'>proto-oncogene
  to an oncogene, without any virus. There are other</span> <span m='1712000'>ways
  by which you can skin this cat. And one experiment to demonstrate</span> <span m='1717000'>that
  is the following. Did we talk at the end of last time</span> <span m='1722000'>about
  the guy who got a bladder carcinoma after 40 years of smoking?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1727000'>I'm glad we did. Good. So, let's say this person gets a,</span> <span
  m='1731000'>has a bladder carcinoma, and he got the bladder carcinoma,</span> <span
  m='1735000'>and it was called an EG bladder carcinoma, and he got it for reasons</span>
  <span m='1739000'>we described last time, and I can't imagine you have any</span>
  <span m='1743000'>illusions about whether smoking is good or bad for you,</span>
  <span m='1747000'>after last time. But anyhow, so, EG bladder carcinoma, pig DNA</span>
  <span m='1750000'>from the tumor, so we make tumor DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1754000'>And
  now, and by the way, we presume correctly that viruses</span> <span m='1758000'>have
  nothing to do with this particular cancer,</span> <span m='1762000'>with the development
  of this cancer, and by the way, the development of a</span> <span m='1766000'>disease
  is another wonderful polysyllabic Greek word,</span> <span m='1770000'>pathogenesis.
  Pathogenesis means the study of how</span> <span m='1774000'>a disease is caused,
  what generates the disease.</span> </p><p><span m='1778000'>So the pathogenesis
  of bladder carcinoma has nothing whatsoever to</span> <span m='1782000'>do with
  any viruses. Maybe it had to do with the fact</span> <span m='1786000'>that cigarette
  smoke mutated genes, mutated, proto-oncogenes in the DNA</span> <span m='1790000'>of
  Mr. Jones, that happens to have been his name,</span> <span m='1794000'>or his pseudonym,
  who knows, Mr. Jones' bladder cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1798000'>So one takes
  tumor DNA here,</span> <span m='1802000'>and one uses the procedure of transfection,
  where you take the DNA,</span> <span m='1806000'>make a DNA, and you put it into
  normal cells, by a gene transfer,</span> <span m='1810000'>or a transfection procedure.
  So, this is transfection,</span> <span m='1814000'>or gene transfer, these are equally
  applicable names,</span> <span m='1818000'>and what was found on this occasion was,
  that one got foci of</span> <span m='1823000'>transformed cells. And these foci,
  for all practical</span> <span m='1827000'>purposes, looked just like the foci that
  Howard Temin had gotten years</span> <span m='1831000'>earlier, by infecting monolayers
  of chicken cells, with Rous</span> <span m='1835000'>Sarcoma Virus. And therefore,</span>
  <span m='1839000'>that suggested very strongly, that the DNA of the bladder</span>
  <span m='1843000'>carcinoma, carried within it, an oncogene that was capable of</span>
  <span m='1847000'>transforming these recipient cells, into which the DNA had been</span>
  <span m='1850000'>introduced by the transfection procedure. It remained,</span>
  <span m='1854000'>of course, to actually find that. I'll mention to you in passing,</span>
  <span m='1858000'>that one does a control experiment here.</span> </p><p><span m='1862000'>If
  you take normal DNA, you do the exact same experiment you</span> <span m='1865000'>never
  get foci. So that means, it's not as if all</span> <span m='1869000'>human DNA carries
  oncogenes in it. The normal DNA doesn't give you</span> <span m='1872000'>foci,
  the DNA from the bladder carcinoma does give you foci.</span> </p><p><span m='1876000'>And
  so, about 20 years ago, one actually looked at the normal DNA</span> <span m='1879000'>and
  the tumor DNA, and one came up with the following,</span> <span m='1883000'>that
  the bladder carcinoma oncogene, was about, let's say, 6KB long,</span> <span m='1886000'>there
  was a corresponding, normal proto-oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>It was
  also 6 kilobasis long. This was a normal DNA, this was</span> <span m='1896000'>extracted
  by cloning, gene cloning, from the genome of the</span> <span m='1903000'>bladder
  carcinoma. And having extracted it,</span> <span m='1910000'>one then began to look
  at how different these two genes were from</span> <span m='1917000'>one another.
  This transformed cells, this did not transform cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1923000'>If
  one did restriction enzyme mapping, one found the identical</span> <span m='1930000'>array
  of restriction enzyme sites. So it was clear that even though</span> <span m='1935000'>these
  two genes, we can call the normal one a</span> <span m='1939000'>proto-oncogene,
  these two genes were structurally</span> <span m='1942000'>identical, they couldn't
  be absolutely identical,</span> <span m='1946000'>because biologically, they were
  behaving very differently.</span> </p><p><span m='1949000'>And so, when the sequence
  analyses were done, it was discovered that</span> <span m='1953000'>the difference
  between the normal proto-oncogene and the oncogene,</span> <span m='1956000'>was
  a single point mutation, a single-base pair change.</span> </p><p><span m='1960000'>And
  that single-base pair change created a potent oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='1964000'>And
  that single-based pair change, one could show in comparable tumors,</span> <span
  m='1969000'>was a somatic mutation. Remember, we said somatic mutations are</span>
  <span m='1973000'>mutations that strike the genomes of cells in our soma,</span>
  <span m='1978000'>rather than the germ line. That somatic mutation had almost</span>
  <span m='1983000'>surely had struck one of the epithelial cells lining the bladder</span>
  <span m='1987000'>of Mr. Jones' urinary bladder. How did this work?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1992000'>Well, let's go back to our discussion of growth factor</span> <span
  m='1996000'>receptors, you recall we talked about them last time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2000000'>Let's say, here's a growth factor receptor at the cell surface,</span>
  <span m='2004000'>the growth factor receptor sends signals into the cell,</span>
  <span m='2009000'>and such a sequence of signals, where you go from a to b, to c
  to d,</span> <span m='2013000'>is sometimes called a signaling pathway, sometimes
  it's called a</span> <span m='2017000'>signaling cascade, It's a molecular bucket
  brigade</span> <span m='2022000'>where a passes signals to b, passes signals to
  c, to do, and so</span> <span m='2026000'>fourth, and they cross-communicate with
  one another to process this</span> <span m='2031000'>incoming signal from the growth
  factor activated receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='2035000'>Now it turned out that
  the protein product of this,</span> <span m='2040000'>of a normal proto-oncogene,
  and the bladder carcinoma oncogene,</span> <span m='2044000'>sat right down here,
  in the signaling cascade,</span> <span m='2049000'>downstream in the signaling cascade
  of the growth factor receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='2054000'>And the protein product
  was a very interesting protein,</span> <span m='2058000'>it was a protein, which
  came to be called RAS, in fact,</span> <span m='2062000'>the original proto-oncogene
  had previously been associated with a</span> <span m='2066000'>retrovirus. But in
  this case, it was clear that the activation of</span> <span m='2070000'>the proto-oncogene
  to the oncogene had nothing to do whatever,</span> <span m='2074000'>with the intervention,
  by a retrovirus, or by the acquisition of</span> <span m='2078000'>a retrovirus,
  by a normal proto-oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='2082000'>So RAS has the normal,
  the following normal lifestyle.</span> </p><p><span m='2087000'>RAS normally exists
  in a quiet state, an inactive state,</span> <span m='2093000'>so here's RAS, and
  while it's in the quiet state it binds GDP,</span> <span m='2098000'>guanosine diphosphate,
  GDP. What happens, then, is that RAS on</span> <span m='2104000'>occasion, gets
  an incoming signal from some upstream activator,</span> <span m='2110000'>and you
  can imagine what the upstream activator is from here.</span> </p><p><span m='2116000'>Keep
  in mind, I'm only focusing now on, let's say,</span> <span m='2121000'>component
  c of this signaling cascade, so an upstream activator</span> <span m='2126000'>comes
  in, and impinges on RAS. And in so doing, it wants to switch</span> <span m='2131000'>RAS
  from a quiet to an activated state. So what happens,</span> <span m='2136000'>when
  RAS gets a signal from, an upstream signal from here,</span> <span m='2142000'>RAS
  will shed its GDP, and will instead, allow a GTP</span> <span m='2147000'>to jump
  aboard. So now a GTP can jump aboard,</span> <span m='2152000'>and now RAS is in
  its active state up here. And while it's in its</span> <span m='2156000'>active
  state, it can emit growth stimulatory signals into the cell,</span> <span m='2161000'>like
  that. I'm not showing you exactly what it looks like,</span> <span m='2165000'>but
  it can emit signals. And this is, by the way,</span> <span m='2170000'>called a
  signal transducing protein, a protein that tranduces signals</span> <span m='2174000'>receives
  signals from higher up in the cascade, and passes them on</span> <span m='2179000'>lower
  into the cascade. So it's transducing these signals,</span> <span m='2183000'>and
  so RAS is put, here I should've capitalized RAS here,</span> <span m='2188000'>so
  RAS is now in its active state.</span> </p><p><span m='2193000'>It's received upstream
  signals, it's shed its GDP, its bound GDP,</span> <span m='2196000'>and while it's
  there, RAS passes signals on further downstream in the</span> <span m='2200000'>pathway.
  So, if want to relate it to the signaling cascade,</span> <span m='2204000'>and
  we imagine that RAS is component c of this cascade,</span> <span m='2208000'>it
  receives signals from b, and then RAS passes signals onto d,</span> <span m='2212000'>it's
  sitting in-between them, it's an intermediary,</span> <span m='2216000'>it's a member
  of this molecular bucket-brigade.</span> </p><p><span m='2220000'>Now what happens
  is that RAS is in this active state for only a period</span> <span m='2224000'>of
  usually milliseconds, and after it's in a period of this</span> <span m='2229000'>active
  stage, and it's emitting growth stimulatory signals,</span> <span m='2234000'>downstream,
  for a period of milliseconds, RAS does something</span> <span m='2238000'>very interesting.
  It hydrolyzes the GTP,</span> <span m='2243000'>and when it hydrolyzes the GTP into
  GDP, obviously an inorganic</span> <span m='2248000'>phosphate comes out, RAS switches
  itself off,</span> <span m='2252000'>i.e. RAS has an intrinsic GTPase activity,
  GTPase means</span> <span m='2257000'>it can cleave GTP. So it's as if there was
  a switch</span> <span m='2261000'>here, and I could turn it on, well I'm not going
  to mess with it</span> <span m='2265000'>since I still haven't figured out how the
  switches work,</span> <span m='2268000'>but it's as if there was a light switch
  here that I could switch on,</span> <span m='2272000'>and the lights would be on
  for a short period of time,</span> <span m='2275000'>and then the switch would automatically
  shut itself off.</span> </p><p><span m='2279000'>A negative-feedback control to
  ensure that the period of activation</span> <span m='2282000'>of the RAS protein
  is only a period of milliseconds,</span> <span m='2286000'>and that the pulse of
  downstream signals that are released is finite,</span> <span m='2289000'>circumscribed,
  limited, it's only a quantum of signals that</span> <span m='2293000'>are released.
  After which occasion,</span> <span m='2296000'>RAS hydrolyzes it's GTP and shuts
  itself off. It's a nice system,</span> <span m='2300000'>and it actually works because,
  as I've told you before,</span> <span m='2304000'>we go through ten of the sixteenth
  cell divisions,</span> <span m='2307000'>with RAS proteins in our cells, and rarely,
  if we lead virtuous</span> <span m='2311000'>lives and listen to everything I've
  said in the last lecture,</span> <span m='2315000'>do we ever get cancer. So, what
  happens when the RAS encoding</span> <span m='2318000'>gene becomes mutated in cancer?
  That's another one of those</span> <span m='2322000'>questions that I'm really glad
  I asked, because what happens is that</span> <span m='2326000'>the ability of the
  GTPase activity to function, is knocked out.</span> </p><p><span m='2330000'>The
  GTPase can no longer operate, and therefore, the ability of RAS to</span> <span
  m='2335000'>shut itself off, by cleaving GTP down to GDP,</span> <span m='2340000'>is
  now compromised, and as a consequence, RAS is trapped for</span> <span m='2345000'>extended
  periods of time, for minutes and hours, and maybe</span> <span m='2350000'>even
  days, in this excited signal-emitting configuration,</span> <span m='2355000'>on
  which occasion, it sends out a continuous flood of signals.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2360000'>In fact, we now know that the point-mutation,</span> <span m='2364000'>which
  happens in the gene here, and is seen, by the way, in about</span> <span m='2368000'>20%
  of human cancers that have virtually identical point-mutations,</span> <span m='2372000'>those,
  that point mutation is in the GTPase domain of the RAS protein,</span> <span m='2376000'>that
  is normally responsible for cleaving GTP into GDP.</span> </p><p><span m='2381000'>So
  now we can begin to get a very concrete and specific understanding,</span> <span
  m='2385000'>an insight, into the mechanism by which a point mutation,</span> <span
  m='2389000'>a somatic mutation, can have a dramatic effect on the ability of a</span>
  <span m='2393000'>cell to grow. Note, by the way,</span> <span m='2398000'>that
  if RAS is sending signals constitutively down here,</span> <span m='2403000'>and
  you may recall that the word constitutive means,</span> <span m='2409000'>at a constant
  and unrelenting fashion. So the ability of RAS,</span> <span m='2414000'>which I
  depicted as residing right in here in the signaling cascade,</span> <span m='2419000'>to
  send out signals unrelentingly down like this,</span> <span m='2424000'>means that
  the signals up here are no longer so important.</span> </p><p><span m='2430000'>RAS
  might require a brief stimulus to get into this activated state,</span> <span m='2434000'>but
  then it can sit around for hours and days, pushing the cell to</span> <span m='2438000'>proliferate.
  And the subsequent exposure of a cell carrying a RAS</span> <span m='2442000'>oncogene
  is now gratuitous, it's unnecessary, because this</span> <span m='2447000'>downstream
  signal emitter has gone wild, and is firing and pushing the</span> <span m='2451000'>cell
  to grow unrelentingly. Interestingly, that signal is very</span> <span m='2455000'>critically
  important in pushing cells to move through the G1 phase</span> <span m='2459000'>of
  their growth and division cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='2464000'>In other words,
  it's during that phase of the</span> <span m='2468000'>division cycle, that RAS
  is actually able to send</span> <span m='2472000'>it's signals that perturb cell
  cycling, and push the cell to move</span> <span m='2476000'>from G1 up to the restriction
  point, and then into the remaining part of</span> <span m='2480000'>the cell cycle.
  So now we see how somatic mutations,</span> <span m='2484000'>and we now know about
  dozens of such genes, can convert proto-oncogenes</span> <span m='2488000'>to oncogenes,
  without the intervention of any retrovirus.</span> </p><p><span m='2493000'>There
  are yet another class of genes, which are called,</span> <span m='2497000'>tumor
  suppressor genes, and these tumor suppressor genes</span> <span m='2502000'>operate
  in exactly the opposite way as proto-oncogenes and oncogenes.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2506000'>The proto-oncogenes and oncogenes, from what I've told you, you can</span>
  <span m='2511000'>imagine are functioning analogously to accelerator pedals on a
  car,</span> <span m='2516000'>they push the cell to proliferate and, when you have
  a cancer,</span> <span m='2520000'>the accelerator pedal gets stuck to the floor.
  In other words,</span> <span m='2525000'>it's no longer well regulated. The tumor
  suppressor genes work in</span> <span m='2529000'>an opposite fashion, as a breaking
  system to slow down</span> <span m='2533000'>cell proliferation. And, as such, tumor
  suppressor</span> <span m='2537000'>genes operate to counteract, and counterbalance,
  and limit,</span> <span m='2541000'>the growth stimulatory signals that are coming
  from the RAS gene,</span> <span m='2545000'>and other growth promoting genes. So
  there's two sides to the coin,</span> <span m='2548000'>indeed as you can imagine
  from circuit theory,</span> <span m='2552000'>any positive signal must be counter
  balanced by a negative signal,</span> <span m='2556000'>so that you end up having
  some kind of physical balance that is</span> <span m='2560000'>compatible with normal,
  biological function.</span> </p><p><span m='2564000'>So these tumor suppressor genes
  are normally functioning as break,</span> <span m='2568000'>break linings of a cell,
  if you will, and that also describes how they</span> <span m='2572000'>become involved
  in cancer. The mutation that struck the RAS</span> <span m='2576000'>gene caused
  a hyper-activation of the proto-oncogene.</span> </p><p><span m='2580000'>The proto-oncogene
  was hyper-activated,</span> <span m='2584000'>and now it began sending out an unrelenting
  stream of growth-stimulatory</span> <span m='2588000'>signals. As you can imagine,</span>
  <span m='2592000'>as it is intuitively obvious, in the case of tumor suppressor</span>
  <span m='2596000'>genes, when they became involved in cancer, what kind of mutations</span>
  <span m='2600000'>affect them? Inactivating mutations. So there's a very interesting
  gene,</span> <span m='2604000'>it's called the retinoblastoma gene, and the retinoblastoma
  gene,</span> <span m='2608000'>the retinoblastoma is a rare eye-tumor of children,</span>
  <span m='2613000'>it happens about 1/20,000 kids, and the retinoblastoma gene, if
  you</span> <span m='2617000'>look at the retinoblastoma gene in the genomes of tumor
  cells,</span> <span m='2621000'>these are the eye cells that form the precursors,</span>
  <span m='2625000'>the rods and the cones, and other neuronal cells lining the</span>
  <span m='2629000'>retina. Here's the normal retinoblastoma</span> <span m='2634000'>gene,
  and it's 190 kilo basis long. So it's a pretty nice size gene,</span> <span m='2638000'>it's
  not the biggest, it's not the smallest.</span> </p><p><span m='2642000'>If you look
  at many retinoblastoma tumors, what you find is that there</span> <span m='2646000'>are
  major portions of the gene that have been just deleted.</span> </p><p><span m='2650000'>Here
  I'll show you one deletion, here's another deletion, here's a</span> <span m='2654000'>third
  deletion, sometimes the whole gene is deleted,</span> <span m='2658000'>and cut
  out. Obviously such deletions are not</span> <span m='2661000'>enhancing the function
  of the retinoblastoma gene,</span> <span m='2665000'>obviously they're wiping it
  out. And therefore, we can begin to</span> <span m='2669000'>imagine that the way
  that the tumor suppressor genes are recruited into</span> <span m='2672000'>the
  process of forming cancer is through their elimination,</span> <span m='2676000'>rather
  than through their hyper activation. In fact,</span> <span m='2679000'>as you might
  also imagine, a cell, which has the following</span> <span m='2683000'>genotype,
  RB+, RB-, actually grows normally.</span> </p><p><span m='2687000'>Why? Because
  one of the two alleles has been inactivated,</span> <span m='2690000'>the minus,
  but the other allele is still, is still active,</span> <span m='2694000'>and still
  functional, and still able to create an adequately functional</span> <span m='2698000'>break
  lining. Only when a cell becomes RB- like</span> <span m='2703000'>this, homozygous
  minus, does it begin to grow uncontrollably,</span> <span m='2709000'>because now
  it lacks all ability to manufacture the normally required</span> <span m='2715000'>break
  lining. And this begins, as well, to explain certain kinds of</span> <span m='2721000'>hereditary
  cancers, because in certain individuals,</span> <span m='2727000'>they inherit a
  defective allele of the RGB, and therefore,</span> <span m='2733000'>at the moment
  of conception, they have the following genotype.</span> </p><p><span m='2740000'>Well,
  you'll say that's all, that's fine, because each of their</span> <span m='2744000'>cells
  has a wild-type copy of their RB gene, and a mutant,</span> <span m='2749000'>defective
  copy. And the wild-type copy, as you will correctly say,</span> <span m='2753000'>suffices
  to template, to orchestrate, to program, normal cell behavior.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2758000'>Why do they then get retinoblastomas?</span> </p><p><span m='2763000'>Because
  the surviving wild-type gene, or the gene copy,</span> <span m='2767000'>the wild-type
  allele, can be lost with a certain,</span> <span m='2772000'>finite probability
  per cell generation, through chromosomal</span> <span m='2777000'>mistakes, accidents,
  or through crossing-over.</span> </p><p><span m='2782000'>And so roughly, one in
  ten to the sixth cells,</span> <span m='2786000'>one has an event, a genetic accident,
  which causes the accidental loss of</span> <span m='2791000'>the surviving RB allele,
  leaving, RB wild-type allele,</span> <span m='2795000'>leading now to a genotype
  that looks like this, homozygous mutant,</span> <span m='2800000'>or homozygous
  inactive, and now a rare cell in which that has happened,</span> <span m='2804000'>now
  begins to proliferate uncontrollably because of the</span> <span m='2809000'>absence
  of the RB break lining, which is normally required to</span> <span m='2813000'>control
  cell proliferation. By the way, I'll tell you in passing,</span> <span m='2818000'>without
  describing the gory details, that the RB protein works at the end,</span> <span
  m='2822000'>at the restriction point. We talked about the restriction</span> <span
  m='2826000'>point last time, you remember? The RB protein</span> <span m='2830000'>actually
  prevents the cell from advancing through the restriction</span> <span m='2834000'>point
  gate, unless it becomes inactivated, and then the cell can</span> <span m='2838000'>sail
  through into the rest of the cell cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='2842000'>In cells
  that lack the RB protein, the guardian of the restriction</span> <span m='2848000'>point
  gate is no longer there, and therefore the gate is held open,</span> <span m='2855000'>and
  cells can sail all the way through G1, in an unimpeded fashion,</span> <span m='2862000'>without
  the RB protein standing at the restriction point gate and</span> <span m='2868000'>saying,
  advance no further, unless and until, certain conditions</span> <span m='2875000'>have
  been satisfied. And so we can begin to understand</span> <span m='2880000'>that
  the tumor suppressor gene, the RB gene, is able to act as a</span> <span m='2883000'>quality
  control, to ensure that cells don't</span> <span m='2887000'>inadvertently, inappropriately,</span>
  <span m='2890000'>pass through the restriction point gate into the rest of the cell
  cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='2893000'>And by now, there are 40 or 50 different
  kinds of tumor suppressor</span> <span m='2896000'>genes that are found to be inactivated
  through various</span> <span m='2900000'>mechanisms, in human cancers. This was
  only the progenitor,</span> <span m='2903000'>the harbinger, of those. How many
  tumors does a child who's born like,</span> <span m='2906000'>this get in his eyes,
  or her eyes?</span> </p><p><span m='2910000'>Well, it might get two or three or
  four, in both eyes,</span> <span m='2914000'>but that reflects the fact that there
  maybe a million or two million</span> <span m='2919000'>cells in each of the retina,
  which are susceptible to this loss</span> <span m='2924000'>of the surviving wild-type
  gene copy. Having heard all that,</span> <span m='2929000'>you will ask me, well
  why don't they get tumors all over the body,</span> <span m='2934000'>since it is
  the fact that the RB protein regulates the restriction</span> <span m='2939000'>point
  gate in all cells throughout the body?</span> </p><p><span m='2944000'>So therefore,
  why isn't the child who's born constitutionally,</span> <span m='2947000'>whose
  genetic makeup is this, why isn't a child like this</span> <span m='2950000'>sensitive
  to developing tumors all over his or her body?</span> </p><p><span m='2953000'>In
  fact, children who are born genetically with this genotype,</span> <span m='2957000'>get
  retinoblastoma's with high probability early in life,</span> <span m='2960000'>and
  as teenagers, they often come down with osteosarcomas,</span> <span m='2963000'>which
  are tumors of the bones. But otherwise, they don't get many</span> <span m='2967000'>kinds
  of cancer, and the answer to your question is,</span> <span m='2970000'>I haven't
  the vaguest idea. No one knows why loss of this</span> <span m='2974000'>critical
  gene that plays a key role in the biology,</span> <span m='2978000'>in the metabolism,
  of all cells throughout the body,</span> <span m='2983000'>can be lost to yield
  cancer in the eye and in the bone,</span> <span m='2987000'>whereas when the same
  gene, which must be lost elsewhere in</span> <span m='2992000'>other tissues in
  the body are lost, tumors do not arise. And on that</span> <span m='2996000'>puzzling
  note, I wish you a pleasant day,</span> <span m='3001000'>another happy Halloween,
  and see you on, oh yes, tomorrow is election day.</span> </p><p><span m='3005000'>Don't
  forget to vote. And remember what the mayor of</span> <span m='3010000'>Boston once
  said, vote early and often.</span> </p>
