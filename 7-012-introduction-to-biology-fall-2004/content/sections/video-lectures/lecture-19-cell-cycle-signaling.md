title: 'Lecture 19: Cell Cycle/Signaling'
transcript: <p><span m='1000'>Good morning, class. Nice to be here with you again</span>
  <span m='3000'>after a long hiatus. So, we're going to talk today about</span> <span
  m='7000'>the cell cycle. That is to say the life of a cell,</span> <span m='11000'>how
  a cell grows and divides. And, as it turns out,</span> <span m='15000'>this is one
  of our first entrees into cell biology.</span> </p><p><span m='18000'>That is to
  say we're move, beginning to move away from the</span> <span m='22000'>molecules
  inside cells and beginning to look at a, at the next higher</span> <span m='26000'>level
  of complexity which is how cells proliferate.</span> </p><p><span m='30000'>It turns
  out this is a very critical issue in a number of different</span> <span m='34000'>disease
  areas, including notably cancer which we'll</span> <span m='38000'>start talking
  about next time. And this is also the transition</span> <span m='42000'>point, the
  inflection point in the semester when we begin to apply some</span> <span m='46000'>of
  the things we've learned earlier to learning about specific disease</span> <span
  m='50000'>processes. So, you'll sense more and more</span> <span m='54000'>introduction
  of discussions of human disease processes as the semester</span> <span m='58000'>goes
  from here on to the end. And here, in fact,</span> <span m='62000'>is what we call
  the cell cycle. And I'm going to get into the</span> <span m='66000'>details of
  it quite shortly, but the cell cycle is effectively</span> <span m='70000'>the life
  cycle of a cell from the moment it is born to the moment that</span> <span m='74000'>it,
  in turn, becomes the mother of two daughter cells.</span> </p><p><span m='78000'>And
  this process is divided up, as you can see, into four different</span> <span m='82000'>periods
  here, or as they are called phases. These are cell cycle phases.</span> </p><p><span
  m='86000'>The first phase is called M or mitosis.</span> </p><p><span m='90000'>The
  second phase is called G1 phase. The third is called the S or the</span> <span m='93000'>synthetic
  phase, and that refers to the fact that</span> <span m='97000'>this is the time
  when cells replicate their DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='101000'>And, as you can see,
  it actually takes a long time</span> <span m='105000'>because this entire cycle
  in cultured mammalian cells normally</span> <span m='108000'>takes as much as a
  day for a mammalian cell to divide,</span> <span m='112000'>grow and divide. Contrast
  that, by the way, with many bacterial</span> <span m='116000'>cells which can grow
  and divide in 30, 30 minutes.</span> </p><p><span m='120000'>So, our cells take
  a lot longer to divide, many of them,</span> <span m='124000'>but there are exceptions
  to that. After cells have gone through G,</span> <span m='128000'>through S phase
  they go into G2. And these two Gs are, are called Gs</span> <span m='133000'>because
  of the gaps they have. Here's the gap between S phase and</span> <span m='137000'>M
  phase, or mitosis. G1 is the gap between mitosis and,</span> <span m='142000'>and
  the, the subsequent S phase. And, obviously,</span> <span m='146000'>the most important
  parts of the cell cycle are the time when the cell</span> <span m='151000'>divides,
  which is mitosis, and the time it replicates its DNA</span> <span m='155000'>which
  is in S phase. One reason why it's so important is</span> <span m='160000'>that
  one has to be sure that cells that arise from the process of</span> <span m='164000'>growth
  and division, which is what this is,</span> <span m='168000'>actually end up with
  a full genome's worth of DNA and chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='172000'>And,
  therefore, during S phase there has to be a precise</span> <span m='176000'>replication
  of all the 3. billion bases in the haploid genome,</span> <span m='180000'>or 6.4
  billion in the diploid genome.</span> </p><p><span m='185000'>And during M phase
  there has to be a precise allocation of the resulting</span> <span m='188000'>replicated
  DNA in equal, exactly equal parts to the two</span> <span m='192000'>daughter cells.
  And this is no mean feat.</span> </p><p><span m='196000'>It is an extraordinarily
  challenging process,</span> <span m='200000'>which cells, it turns out, with very
  high efficiency through a</span> <span m='203000'>variety of complex control mechanisms.
  And with this outline</span> <span m='207000'>in mind, I just want to go into some
  of its details to illustrate to you</span> <span m='211000'>why we think that the
  scheme is organized the way it is.</span> </p><p><span m='215000'>The fact of the
  matter is that the, that the M phase, or the mitosis is</span> <span m='219000'>actually
  organized into a series of sub phases. And you may remember</span> <span m='223000'>that
  from high school biology but I'll just go into it in some detail,</span> <span m='227000'>not
  because we're going to dwell on it but just because I want to give</span> <span
  m='231000'>you a feeling for what it's composed of. It's composed of a series of,</span>
  <span m='235000'>of sub, sub phases I just mentioned. And, importantly, we start
  out with</span> <span m='239000'>an interphase cell. And interphase refers to the</span>
  <span m='244000'>entirety of the cell cycle outside of M. That is the entirety,</span>
  <span m='248000'>entirety outside of the M phase thereby including G1S and G2.</span>
  </p><p><span m='252000'>And you notice that what happens in prophase is, first of
  all,</span> <span m='256000'>the chromosomes condense. And that's very important
  because prior</span> <span m='261000'>to that condensation the chromatin, and chromatin
  represents the</span> <span m='265000'>material out of which the chromosomes is
  assembled consisting</span> <span m='269000'>largely of DNA and proteins with a
  big of RNA, the chromatin is</span> <span m='273000'>dispersed through the nucleus.
  It's not condensed together.</span> </p><p><span m='277000'>And as such, as you
  can see here, one doesn't see any specific</span> <span m='281000'>chromosomes because
  they're just scattered about the whole</span> <span m='284000'>chromosomes in a
  very dilute form. But once the condensations happen,</span> <span m='287000'>the
  condensation of chromosomes happen then one begins to appreciate</span> <span m='291000'>that
  there are chromosomes. Indeed, if it were not for the case</span> <span m='294000'>that
  this, this condensation would happen, it would have taken a very</span> <span m='298000'>long
  time before we even realized at the beginning of the 20th century</span> <span m='301000'>that
  there were distinct chromosomes themselves.</span> </p><p><span m='305000'>Because
  when you look in the nucleus like this, and as you,</span> <span m='309000'>one
  might do, be doing here stains for DNA, one doesn't see any</span> <span m='313000'>distinct
  structures within the nucleus. Here this condensation</span> <span m='317000'>causes
  a delineation of these structures in humans,</span> <span m='322000'>as you know
  this being 46. And, by the way, this, this,</span> <span m='326000'>this sequence
  of events is, is basically standard hardware for all</span> <span m='330000'>eukaryote
  cells. It's not as if we invented this</span> <span m='334000'>recently. This whole
  sequence of events has largely been around for 1.</span> </p><p><span m='338000'>billion
  years. One thing you begin to notice here</span> <span m='342000'>already as we
  go into the Metaphase, this is the beginning of metaphase,</span> <span m='346000'>it's
  sometimes called prometaphase if one wants to split it up even</span> <span m='349000'>further,
  is the beginning of the disappearance of the nuclear</span> <span m='353000'>membrane.
  So, here we are in a situation where the</span> <span m='357000'>chromosomes are
  no longer physically separated from the cytoplasm by the</span> <span m='361000'>nuclear
  membrane. The membrane, in effect,</span> <span m='364000'>disappears. It dissolves.
  Obviously, at another point it's</span> <span m='368000'>going to have to reassemble
  when one starts making daughter cells.</span> </p><p><span m='372000'>And at this
  point one begins to see quite distinctly the,</span> <span m='376000'>that, that
  each chromosome is composed of two chromatids.</span> </p><p><span m='379000'>A
  chromatid is each one of these arms. And the fact that there are</span> <span m='383000'>two
  of them is a direct consequence of the previous DNA replication</span> <span m='387000'>which
  made from one chromatid two chromatids.</span> </p><p><span m='391000'>So, these
  two chromatids are identical, one to the other.</span> </p><p><span m='394000'>They're
  the consequence of the previous S phase of,</span> <span m='398000'>the previous
  DNA replication. And if all things have gone well</span> <span m='402000'>then these
  two chromatids have identical DNA sequences because</span> <span m='406000'>they're
  the descendants of a single chromatid that existed,</span> <span m='410000'>actually
  a chromosome as it's called at that point,</span> <span m='414000'>existed at the
  beginning of S phase. In fact, the fidelity of DNA</span> <span m='418000'>replication,
  that is to say the accuracy with which DNA is</span> <span m='422000'>replicated
  is so good that often one can demonstrate that the mistakes</span> <span m='426000'>that
  are made are less than one in ten to the ninth bases.</span> </p><p><span m='430000'>That's
  stunning. One in ten to the ninth,</span> <span m='434000'>only one in ten to the
  ninth basis actually is, ends up being miscopies.</span> </p><p><span m='438000'>In
  fact, we now realize that the reason why there's such enormous</span> <span m='442000'>fidelity
  is that the DNA polymerases that previously begin to replicate</span> <span m='446000'>the
  DNA to generate these chromatids make a mistake of about one in ten</span> <span
  m='450000'>to the minus five bases. So, they're much more error prone.</span> </p><p><span
  m='455000'>But there are subsequent proofreading mechanisms.</span> </p><p><span
  m='459000'>Just the way you would copy edit text, there are proofreading</span>
  <span m='463000'>mechanism which erase those errors and reduce the end result of</span>
  <span m='468000'>miscopying, of misreplication down in one, down to one and ten
  to the</span> <span m='472000'>minus ninth. And given that the genome itself is
  only,</span> <span m='476000'>the haploid genome is only 3. billion, that is 3.2
  times ten to</span> <span m='481000'>the ninth basis of DNA, that means that there
  are only about,</span> <span m='485000'>roughly speaking, three mistakes made in
  the entire</span> <span m='489000'>genome each time a cell goes through a cell cycle
  in the haploid genome.</span> </p><p><span m='494000'>Now, what we begin to notice
  here in prometaphase is also the beginning</span> <span m='498000'>of the assembly
  of the machinery that will eventually divide those</span> <span m='502000'>two chromatids
  from one another. And here, in the midst of metaphase,</span> <span m='506000'>as
  you see in the top left, now the chromosomes line up in what</span> <span m='510000'>is
  effectively a two-dimensional plane in the middle.</span> </p><p><span m='515000'>It's
  called an equatorial plane in the middle of the cell.</span> </p><p><span m='519000'>Where,
  as you can see here in this schematic, each chrome,</span> <span m='523000'>each
  chromosome is, here's once again the two chromatids,</span> <span m='527000'>and
  these chromid, the places where these two chromatids are held</span> <span m='531000'>together
  are lined up in this plane with the arms of the chromosomes</span> <span m='535000'>kind
  of flopping around, as you can see here. What's</span> <span m='539000'>critical
  here is the points where these, these two chrome,</span> <span m='543000'>chromatids
  are joint. And those, those points of joining,</span> <span m='548000'>as I'll mention
  in a moment, those are called centromeres.</span> </p><p><span m='552000'>Here,
  here is a more schematized view of what's about to happen,</span> <span m='556000'>just
  to give you a feeling for what this really looks like.</span> </p><p><span m='560000'>And
  here, as, as we begin to move later into the mitosis,</span> <span m='565000'>we
  begin to see that each of the chromatids is joined here by a</span> <span m='569000'>centromere
  and that there, and that there are mitotic spindles</span> <span m='573000'>which
  are reaching from these paired chromosomes to centrioles at either</span> <span
  m='577000'>side of the cell. So, these two centrioles,</span> <span m='582000'>and
  the whole apparatus itself is called a centrosome,</span> <span m='586000'>have
  microtubules that reach from, from the centro, from the</span> <span m='591000'>centromeres
  here in the chromosomes, so the, so the structure in the</span> <span m='595000'>middle
  of the chromosome is called a centromere.</span> </p><p><span m='600000'>Via microtubules
  that reach all the way over to one pole or the other.</span> </p><p><span m='605000'>So,
  you see, one effect has two poles here. And if,</span> <span m='610000'>and if we
  begin to develop this further, we, we've just gotten into</span> <span m='615000'>serious
  metaphase here. And now what we see in anaphase is</span> <span m='620000'>that
  the two chromatids are being separated apart,</span> <span m='625000'>they're being
  pulled apart by these microtubule spindles.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>These
  are called spindle fibers, which reach from each of those</span> <span m='634000'>centrosomes
  over here back to the chromosomes, and literally are</span> <span m='638000'>involved
  in the mechanical pulling them apart, one from the other.</span> </p><p><span m='642000'>And
  to state the obvious, if we're talking about the fidelity of DNA</span> <span m='646000'>replication,
  here we need also to talk about the fact that when one</span> <span m='650000'>has
  a set of paired chromatids, one of the chromatids has to go to</span> <span m='654000'>one
  side and one to the other. That, in itself, is in principle</span> <span m='658000'>also
  an error-prone mechanism, or an error-prone process.</span> </p><p><span m='662000'>Mistakes
  could be made. And indeed in cancer cells where</span> <span m='665000'>many of
  these processes break down sometimes one has both chromatids</span> <span m='669000'>going
  to one or the other side. And as you can intuit from that,</span> <span m='673000'>that
  leads obviously to a disruption of the normal makeup of the</span> <span m='676000'>chromosomes
  that are eventually allocated to each of the two</span> <span m='680000'>daughter
  cells. In fact, this allocation happens</span> <span m='684000'>here at telophase,
  the last of the four major sub</span> <span m='688000'>phases of mitosis. Here you
  see that what's happened is</span> <span m='691000'>that the, these chromatids have
  now been pulled apart.</span> </p><p><span m='695000'>And the moment that they're
  pulled apart and no longer paired up one</span> <span m='699000'>with the other
  they now are recognized, once again,</span> <span m='702000'>to be card-carrying
  chromosomes. So, now here, here you see the</span> <span m='706000'>nomenclature
  has changed. Now they're chromosomes. They're</span> <span m='710000'>being pulled,
  pulled apart. And, obviously, one wants an</span> <span m='713000'>identical set
  of chromosomes in both daughter cells.</span> </p><p><span m='717000'>And once they're
  allocated to the two future daughter cells the entire</span> <span m='721000'>mitotic
  spindle dissolve. And, as you can imagine,</span> <span m='725000'>there is a reformation,
  as is indicated here schematically and not</span> <span m='729000'>very clearly,
  in the nuclear membrane. So now the whole cell is</span> <span m='733000'>reconstructed
  and now each of the two daughter cells is able,</span> <span m='737000'>in principle,
  to split off one from the other and to go off on its merry</span> <span m='741000'>way.
  And this looks like a really neat process. And in some</span> <span m='745000'>eukaryotic
  cells it happens much more rapidly than the 24 hours that</span> <span m='749000'>I
  just indicated to you. There are indications that in some</span> <span m='754000'>lymphocyte
  populations it only takes three or four hours.</span> </p><p><span m='758000'>And
  in some early embryonic cell populations, where there's an</span> <span m='762000'>absolutely
  frenetic pace of cell growth and division,</span> <span m='766000'>it may happen
  every 30 minutes rather than the 24 hours I just</span> <span m='770000'>talked
  about. And you'll say, so what, that, who cares about that.</span> </p><p><span
  m='774000'>But 30 minutes for replicating an entire 6.4 billion bases of DNA and</span>
  <span m='778000'>then allocating them to two daughter cells is actually quite</span>
  <span m='782000'>an achievement. And we don't really understand how</span> <span
  m='785000'>that happens. I've talked implicitly about the process of cell</span>
  <span m='789000'>growth and division. And what I mean to say in more</span> <span
  m='793000'>detail about that is the following. After one gets these two initial</span>
  <span m='797000'>daughter cells they're obviously only half the size of the previously</span>
  <span m='801000'>existing mother cell. And, therefore, what must happen in</span>
  <span m='805000'>the subsequent cell cycle is that each of these daughter cells
  must</span> <span m='809000'>actually physically grow in size so that it once again
  becomes a big</span> <span m='813000'>mama over here after the next cell cycle.</span>
  </p><p><span m='817000'>And so that growth begins immediately. And much of it occurs</span>
  <span m='820000'>just through the generation of new sets of ribosomes,</span> <span
  m='824000'>new proteins, new membranes in the cell. All of the complex</span> <span
  m='827000'>constituents of a cell need to be duplicated for the next cell cycle</span>
  <span m='831000'>including, obviously, all of the organelles,</span> <span m='834000'>the
  small structures in the cytoplasm and including,</span> <span m='838000'>indeed,
  the mitochondria. So, imagine now the complexity of</span> <span m='842000'>this
  because not only is the eukaryotic cell so complex but its</span> <span m='846000'>entire
  contents must be faithfully replicated during the subsequent</span> <span m='851000'>cell
  cycle. And that obviously implies the intervention,</span> <span m='855000'>the
  involvement of very complex control mechanisms about which we</span> <span m='859000'>understand
  almost nothing. Now, how, let's get back to this</span> <span m='864000'>for a moment,
  because what I've been talking about over the last six to</span> <span m='868000'>eight
  minutes is simply mitosis, the M phase here.</span> </p><p><span m='873000'>In fact,
  in many of these early embryonic cell cycles,</span> <span m='877000'>what happens
  is that cells go from M phase directly into S phase and from</span> <span m='881000'>S
  phase directly into M. In other words, they don't indulge</span> <span m='885000'>themselves
  in a period over here, a long period, and in some cultured</span> <span m='889000'>mammalian
  cells this can be 12 or 14 hours of getting set,</span> <span m='893000'>getting
  prepared for DNA replication.</span> </p><p><span m='898000'>Similarly, after cells
  have replicated their DNA,</span> <span m='901000'>and as we just said, for example,
  converted one chromosome into two</span> <span m='905000'>paired chromatids, after
  they get through S phase</span> <span m='909000'>they'll also wait another four
  or five hours, most cultured mammalian</span> <span m='913000'>cells before they
  go back into M phase, these two gap periods.</span> </p><p><span m='916000'>Well,
  how do we actually know how long each of these gaps takes?</span> </p><p><span m='920000'>Well,
  as is usual, I'm glad I asked that question.</span> </p><p><span m='924000'>And
  one way we can do so is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='928000'>What we can
  do is we can take cells and we can block them in mitosis.</span> </p><p><span m='932000'>How
  can we block them in mitosis? We can use a microtubule antagonist.</span> </p><p><span
  m='937000'>So, I told you before that the spindle fibers that pull the</span> <span
  m='942000'>chromosomes apart are made of microtubules. Microtubules happen</span>
  <span m='947000'>to be one of the constituents of the cytoskeleton that gives structure
  to</span> <span m='952000'>the cell, and these microtubules are used as the fibers
  for pulling apart</span> <span m='957000'>the two chromatids during anaphase, as
  I just mentioned.</span> </p><p><span m='962000'>And we can use a microtubule antagonist.
  And in biochemistry,</span> <span m='966000'>when you want to antagonize something
  often you use a symbol</span> <span m='970000'>like this. And, for instance, here's
  a drug called</span> <span m='975000'>colcemid, and colcemid is a microtubule antagonist.</span>
  </p><p><span m='979000'>And even though it has a bit of an effect on the overall
  cytoskeleton,</span> <span m='983000'>if you put colcemid on cells then they'll
  go into mitosis like this</span> <span m='988000'>and they'll go into metaphase,
  as we indicated before, but the</span> <span m='992000'>subsequent sub phases of
  mitosis will, will grind to a halt.</span> </p><p><span m='997000'>Why? Because
  the microtubule spindle fibers will be unable to</span> <span m='1001000'>assemble
  properly because of this, now, I forget whether there's an E</span> <span m='1006000'>here
  or not. Probably not. OK. Typo. The colcemid prevents</span> <span m='1010000'>the
  spindle fibers from forming, so therefore cells get hung up, they</span> <span m='1015000'>get
  blocked in M phase. In fact, if you're interested in</span> <span m='1020000'>looking
  at the, at the array of chromosomes in a</span> <span m='1024000'>cell, the simplest
  way of doing it with a mammalian,</span> <span m='1028000'>with a human cell is
  to put colcemid in it, and the colcemid will block</span> <span m='1032000'>them
  in, in M phase, they'll block them in,</span> <span m='1036000'>in metaphase, they
  can't get out of metaphase simply because these pink</span> <span m='1040000'>fibers
  here are unable to assemble properly, and therefore they get</span> <span m='1044000'>hung
  up right here while the chromosomes are condensed.</span> </p><p><span m='1049000'>And
  this allows you to visualize the chromosomes under the microscope.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1053000'>Why do need to do that? Well, in the absence of blocking cells and</span>
  <span m='1057000'>trapping them in, in metaphase, cells will just spin</span> <span
  m='1061000'>right around the cell cycle and they'll only be in metaphase for</span>
  <span m='1065000'>maybe only 10 or 15 minutes out of the 24 hours. And,</span> <span
  m='1070000'>therefore, in a population of cells which is moving around the cell</span>
  <span m='1074000'>cycle willy-nilly very rapidly, only a minute fraction of the
  cells</span> <span m='1078000'>at any one point in time will, by chance, be in metaphase
  when you</span> <span m='1082000'>want to study their chromosomes. So, the best
  thing to do is to try</span> <span m='1087000'>to block them in metaphase. Now,
  what you can do, in fact,</span> <span m='1092000'>is put cells in metaphase, and
  I'm going to draw the cell cycle around</span> <span m='1096000'>here again. Here's
  M, here's S phase, slightly different</span> <span m='1101000'>than what we just
  saw before, here's G1, and here is G2. So,</span> <span m='1106000'>now we're going
  to block cells with colcemid right here in metaphase.</span> </p><p><span m='1111000'>And
  now what happens is that we put metaphase in. Ideally,</span> <span m='1115000'>if
  we put it in for a day we'd start out with a population of cells which</span> <span
  m='1119000'>we will call asynchronous. Asynchronous means that at any one</span>
  <span m='1123000'>point in time these cells will be distributed randomly around
  the cell</span> <span m='1127000'>cycle. They'll be all over the place, obviously,</span>
  <span m='1131000'>because there's nothing to cause them to move synchronously through</span>
  <span m='1135000'>the cell cycle. A random population of cells will be</span> <span
  m='1139000'>scattered all over the cells cycle like this. We put in colcemid,</span>
  <span m='1143000'>and what's gradually going to happen is that cells are moving
  around the</span> <span m='1147000'>cell cycle and when they get to here they'll
  start piling up.</span> </p><p><span m='1151000'>In principle, if all the cells
  are scattered around the cell cycle at</span> <span m='1155000'>the moment you put
  in the colcemid, and it takes them 24 hours to get</span> <span m='1159000'>all
  the way around the cell cycle, then after a day's worth of colcemid</span> <span
  m='1163000'>treatment all the cells should have piled up right here.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1167000'>In fact, you can begin to look. What, what's the kinetics with which</span>
  <span m='1171000'>cells pile up into the M phase? And it looks like this. They go</span>
  <span m='1175000'>around, they go on piling up, and then at the end of 24 hours
  they</span> <span m='1180000'>plateau. Why do they plateau at 24 hours? Because
  by 24 hours the</span> <span m='1184000'>stragglers, which started out right here,
  will have had time to go all</span> <span m='1188000'>the way around the cell cycle
  and get trapped in M phase.</span> </p><p><span m='1193000'>And that gives you a
  feeling for how long the entire cell cycle time</span> <span m='1197000'>is, now,
  or this cycle which I called growth and division.</span> </p><p><span m='1202000'>And,
  again, to emphasize, growth is literally the physical</span> <span m='1205000'>growth
  of the cell. Division is the production of two</span> <span m='1209000'>daughter
  cells at mitosis. Now, in principle, we can relieve</span> <span m='1212000'>this
  metaphase block by getting rid of the colcemid.</span> </p><p><span m='1216000'>And
  now, interestingly enough, we have a population of cells that</span> <span m='1219000'>is
  emerging from metaphase synchronously.</span> </p><p><span m='1223000'>What do I
  mean by that? I mean to indicate that they're all</span> <span m='1227000'>moving
  in lockstep. They're all moving at the same time</span> <span m='1230000'>out of
  the cell cycle, so now there's a whole cohort of</span> <span m='1234000'>cells
  which starts out right here. They've all left metaphase at the</span> <span m='1237000'>same
  time. This is not an asynchronous culture.</span> </p><p><span m='1241000'>And they
  start moving around, advancing around the cell cycle</span> <span m='1245000'>together.
  In principle you'd say, well, they should remain synchronous</span> <span m='1248000'>forever.
  But the fact is all of these phases of the cell cycle,</span> <span m='1252000'>the
  times are quasi-stochastic, sometimes go, some cells go through</span> <span m='1255000'>G1
  in ten hours, some cells go through cells in</span> <span m='1259000'>eleven hours,
  some through in eight hours.</span> </p><p><span m='1263000'>And, as a consequence,
  as they move further and further</span> <span m='1267000'>around the cell cycle,
  the population of cells becomes</span> <span m='1271000'>progressively more asynchronous
  and they won't really enter into the</span> <span m='1275000'>next M phase totally
  synchronously. But now we can ask the following</span> <span m='1280000'>question,
  how long is G1? And the way we can do that is to do</span> <span m='1284000'>another
  kind of experiment where what we do is we release cells,</span> <span m='1288000'>a
  population of cells from M phase by removing the colcemid,</span> <span m='1292000'>for
  example. And now we treat cells,</span> <span m='1297000'>we, we treat aliquots
  of this synchronously advancing population.</span> </p><p><span m='1301000'>Each
  hour we pluck out some of these cells and we expose them for,</span> <span m='1306000'>let's
  say, the next hour thereafter to some tritiated thymidine.</span> </p><p><span m='1311000'>Tritiated
  thymidine, as you may recall, H3 thymidine as it's</span> <span m='1315000'>sometimes
  denoted, is obviously a radiolabeled</span> <span m='1320000'>precursor of DNA.
  And it's going to get incorporated</span> <span m='1325000'>into the DNA and, and
  to no other macromolecules in</span> <span m='1329000'>the cell. And so the question
  is if we expose cells for an hour here to</span> <span m='1333000'>tritiated thymidine,
  how much tritiated thymidine is</span> <span m='1337000'>going to be incorporated
  into their DNA? How do we know what's</span> <span m='1341000'>incorporated and
  how much tritiated thymidine remains unincorporated?</span> </p><p><span m='1345000'>We
  extract the DNA from the cells and we precipitate it in an acid.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1350000'>And when that happens the macromolecules of DNA go to the</span> <span
  m='1353000'>bottom, they precipitate, and the unincorporated tritiated</span> <span
  m='1357000'>thymidine, which is still soluble, it has not yet been polymerized into</span>
  <span m='1361000'>DNA molecules, remains in the acid solution.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1365000'>So, we asked how much acid-precipitable thymidine counts</span> <span
  m='1369000'>are there here? How many in the next,</span> <span m='1373000'>are made
  in the next hour with another aliquot of cells?</span> </p><p><span m='1377000'>How
  many in the next hour and so forth? And when we do such an</span> <span m='1381000'>experiment
  we find that we get a, a curve which looks like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1385000'>All
  of a sudden, here we got no sales labeling,</span> <span m='1388000'>in the second
  hour none, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, in the seventh</span> <span m='1392000'>hour
  there are some cells which make DNA, in the eighth hour there are</span> <span m='1396000'>some
  cells, even more cells making DNA, and by the time they're in the</span> <span m='1399000'>ninth
  or the tenth hour then we find a high rate of DNA synthesis.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1403000'>Now, in principle we could continue this experiment if we wanted to,</span>
  <span m='1407000'>if we had enough money for tritiated thymidine, which one does
  because</span> <span m='1411000'>it's very cheap. And what would find is if we started</span>
  <span m='1414000'>labeling over here with, for another hour pulse, when I say</span>
  <span m='1418000'>an hour pulse I mean we just put the tritiated thymidine in at
  the</span> <span m='1421000'>beginning of this one-hour period way over here,</span>
  <span m='1424000'>and an hour later we take out the cells and extract their DNA
  and</span> <span m='1428000'>measure how much DNA has been incorporated in that
  interval.</span> </p><p><span m='1431000'>And if we did a tritiated thymidine pulse
  over here,</span> <span m='1434000'>we'd begin to see that the rate of DNA synthesis
  was actually lower,</span> <span m='1438000'>and eventually it would go down, back
  down to this as the cells were</span> <span m='1441000'>moving asynchronously through
  the culture.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>What does that mean? Well, this is
  the time,</span> <span m='1449000'>obviously these cells are in S phase, these cells
  were in G1,</span> <span m='1453000'>and these cells have now emerged from S phase
  into G2 and are no</span> <span m='1458000'>longer making DNA. And on that basis
  we can actually</span> <span m='1462000'>calculate, we can determine how many hours
  it takes for cells to move</span> <span m='1467000'>through G1. We can do a similar
  kind of experiment to figure out how</span> <span m='1471000'>long G2 is, the gap
  2, G2 phase is. G2, recall, is the time between the</span> <span m='1476000'>ending
  of DNA replication and the beginning of mitosis.</span> </p><p><span m='1481000'>And
  how do we do that? Well, we can do an inhibitor of DNA</span> <span m='1486000'>synthesis.
  So, let's say, here is,</span> <span m='1492000'>I'm going to redraw the cell cycle.
  Here's S phase, G2, I'm drawing it</span> <span m='1497000'>again, here's M, and
  here's G1. And now what we can do is we'll add</span> <span m='1502000'>a DNA synthesis
  inhibitor. An inhibitor of DNA synthesis has</span> <span m='1506000'>no effect,
  as you could imagine, on M phase. This is one of those</span> <span m='1510000'>things,
  it's called hydroxyurea. It actually blocks the biosynthesis</span> <span m='1514000'>of
  the precursors, the, the oxyribonucleoside</span> <span m='1519000'>triphosphate
  precursors of DNA. And, therefore, you add hydroxyurea</span> <span m='1523000'>to
  cells and they, their, their DNA replication grinds</span> <span m='1527000'>to
  a halt. OK. So, let's do that.</span> </p><p><span m='1531000'>And we'll, we'll,
  we'll add hydroxyurea to the cells for 24</span> <span m='1535000'>hours. What's
  going to happen? What will the distribution of cells</span> <span m='1539000'>be
  afterwards? Well, in fact,</span> <span m='1542000'>some of the cells, when we first
  added the hydroxyurea</span> <span m='1546000'>the cells were scattered all around,
  they were asynchronous. We'll add</span> <span m='1549000'>the hydroxyurea and what
  we'll find is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1553000'>The cells that were
  in the middle of S phase when we added the</span> <span m='1557000'>hydroxyurea
  will be stuck dead in the water. They won't be able to</span> <span m='1560000'>move
  anymore. So, these cells that were in S phase,</span> <span m='1564000'>the moment
  we add the hydroxyurea will be trapped right here.</span> </p><p><span m='1568000'>They
  cannot make anymore DNA. And, therefore, they'll be frozen</span> <span m='1572000'>at
  many points, times, points in time in S phase.</span> </p><p><span m='1576000'>The
  cells that are outside of S phase, they can continue to advance</span> <span m='1580000'>all
  the way around the cell cycle. And, accordingly, there'll be lots</span> <span m='1584000'>of
  cells over the next 24 hours that are going to just pile up at the</span> <span
  m='1588000'>G1-S transition. Why? Well, the hydroxyurea has no effect</span> <span
  m='1592000'>at all on these other points of the cell cycle. And when these cells</span>
  <span m='1596000'>try to go, go from G1 into S, they cannot get into S phase because</span>
  <span m='1601000'>they can't make any DNA so they're trapped right over there.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1606000'>And now we'll take away the hydroxyurea, which is,</span>
  <span m='1610000'>obviously is, to use the notation I used before, an inhibitor
  of DNA</span> <span m='1615000'>synthesis. And what we can do now is the following.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1620000'>We're going to ask, after we take out the hydroxyurea</span>
  <span m='1624000'>we're going to put in colcemid. Why do we want to do that? Well,</span>
  <span m='1628000'>what we really want to do is to ask, after the cells have reached,
  have</span> <span m='1632000'>gone through S phase, how soon does a labeled cell
  move</span> <span m='1636000'>from S phase all the way into M phase? How long does
  it take?</span> </p><p><span m='1640000'>How long is G2? And so what we'll do is
  the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1644000'>We take away the hydroxyurea. This
  allows all these cells to</span> <span m='1648000'>begin to move out. Is this a
  fully synchronous culture?</span> </p><p><span m='1652000'>Well, actually, no, because
  some of these cells are over here.</span> </p><p><span m='1656000'>There's a whole
  bunch over here. These are synchronous, but the rest</span> <span m='1659000'>of
  the ones they're already scattered out,</span> <span m='1662000'>so there's going
  to be some pioneers over here moving ahead of the</span> <span m='1666000'>phalanx,
  and they'll be some straggles and then there's going to</span> <span m='1669000'>be
  a big slug of these cells that are moving as the rear guard ahead.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1673000'>Now, what we're going to do, after we take away the hydroxyurea we're</span>
  <span m='1676000'>going to add our old friend colcemid.</span> </p><p><span m='1680000'>And
  colcemid, I tried to spell it right this time,</span> <span m='1683000'>colcemid
  is going to block cells, as we obviously said before, right</span> <span m='1686000'>over
  here. And then what we're going to do is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1689000'>We're
  going to look, every hour we're going to take some cells and</span> <span m='1692000'>put
  them in colcemid, or we'll leave them in colcemid the</span> <span m='1696000'>whole
  time and every hour we'll take cells out of the Petri dish,</span> <span m='1699000'>which
  have been in colcemid since they were released from here,</span> <span m='1702000'>and
  we're going to look at the metaphase cells.</span> </p><p><span m='1705000'>And
  how do we look at the metaphase cells?</span> </p><p><span m='1709000'>Well, here's
  a metaphase cell. Here will be its chromosomes.</span> </p><p><span m='1713000'>Obviously,
  they're chromatids at this point. They're under the</span> <span m='1717000'>microscope.
  And they start accumulating up here.</span> </p><p><span m='1721000'>And each and
  every hour we're going to take some of these metaphase</span> <span m='1725000'>cells,
  we'll take them out of the Petri dish, and after we've put them</span> <span m='1729000'>in,
  or we'll leave them in the Petri dish if you want,</span> <span m='1733000'>and
  after they're there and they've, they've come over here we'll fix</span> <span m='1737000'>them
  onto the plate. We'll add some alcohol or something</span> <span m='1742000'>which
  causes them to stick to the plate, they can't swim away,</span> <span m='1746000'>and
  then after that we'll add some radioactive emulsion.</span> </p><p><span m='1751000'>So,
  here's, let's imagine here is a cell at the bottom of the plate in</span> <span
  m='1755000'>metaphase, we're going to add some photographic emulsion on top of that</span>
  <span m='1760000'>like that. And then what we're going to see is how soon we can</span>
  <span m='1764000'>detect radioactive metaphase chromosomes. How can we do that?</span>
  </p><p><span m='1769000'>Because each time an electron leaves the tritiated thymidine,</span>
  <span m='1773000'>each time a beta particle leaves it's going to cause a grain of</span>
  <span m='1778000'>emulsion, of silver to form in the, in the photographic emulsion
  that</span> <span m='1782000'>we've layered above the cell. So, this photo emulsion
  is only not</span> <span m='1787000'>a way of detecting light but a way of detecting
  when there,</span> <span m='1793000'>whenever there's radioactivity in, that's being
  emitted. And what</span> <span m='1798000'>we're going to look for are grains, silver
  grains that are located above</span> <span m='1804000'>the chromosomes in the microscope.
  We could look down through this</span> <span m='1808000'>plate, through the emulsion,
  on the chromosomes we can see them</span> <span m='1812000'>clearly. I've shown
  you that before, and we're going to ask ourselves the</span> <span m='1816000'>question,
  when can we begin to associate silver grains with the</span> <span m='1820000'>chromosomes?
  Because those silver grains must have been incorporated</span> <span m='1824000'>into
  the chromosomes during the previous S phase,</span> <span m='1828000'>that is when
  cells were over here. If a cell was over here and we added</span> <span m='1832000'>colcemid
  and there won't be any, it won't be radioactively labeled.</span> </p><p><span m='1836000'>So,
  what we're really going to ask now is the following.</span> </p><p><span m='1840000'>These
  cells are all advancing through like this,</span> <span m='1844000'>they're advancing
  into M phase, when does the first radiolabeled</span> <span m='1848000'>cell get,
  after we release them with hydroxyurea, when does it get,</span> <span m='1853000'>when
  do we first see cells like this? And the fact is after five or six</span> <span
  m='1857000'>hours after we've released them from S phase then we begin to see cells</span>
  <span m='1861000'>like this which have chromosomes on which there is radio,</span>
  <span m='1865000'>with which there's radioactivity associated.</span> </p><p><span
  m='1870000'>Well, keep in mind that when cells move through the S phase here,</span>
  <span m='1875000'>this is when they incorporated tritiated thymidine to their DNA.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1880000'>Cells can't incorporate tritiated thymidine here.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1885000'>They can't incorporate it here. They can't incorporate
  it here.</span> </p><p><span m='1890000'>OK? Right. So, we can allow cells to incorporate
  a</span> <span m='1893000'>little bit of tritiated thymidine, we can freeze them
  in here, we'll</span> <span m='1897000'>allow, give them a little bit, bit of tritiated
  thymidine, let it</span> <span m='1900000'>get into the DNA here, and then we'll
  add hydroxyurea very</span> <span m='1904000'>shortly thereafter and freeze the
  cells right like this.</span> </p><p><span m='1907000'>So, they'll be, they'll be
  radioactive by virtue of having</span> <span m='1911000'>dwelled here at different
  times in the S phase. And when we add</span> <span m='1915000'>hydroxyurea then,
  the cells that were already in S</span> <span m='1918000'>phase and incorporated
  a bit of tritiated thymidine will</span> <span m='1922000'>remain in S phase. All
  of the other cells which were,</span> <span m='1925000'>when we added the hydroxyurea
  over here, they will go all the way</span> <span m='1928000'>around here. They will
  move all the way around the cell cycle.</span> </p><p><span m='1931000'>They might
  have happened to incorporated a little bit of</span> <span m='1934000'>tritiated
  thymidine before we added the hydroxyurea,</span> <span m='1937000'>but they'll
  get trapped over here. So the only, so the cells that have</span> <span m='1941000'>tritiated
  thymidine, they will be scattered at various</span> <span m='1944000'>points in
  the S phase. We'll remove the hydroxyurea that</span> <span m='1947000'>allows the
  cells to escape from S phase and move all the</span> <span m='1950000'>way around
  to here. And then we begin to look for seeing</span> <span m='1954000'>when cells
  get radiolabeled chromosomes. Is that clearer now?</span> </p><p><span m='1960000'>A
  little clear. OK. Now, let's begin to ask how this is all</span> <span m='1965000'>coordinated.
  What determines how cells, when cells will grow and when</span> <span m='1971000'>cells
  with not grow? So, let's go back to our depiction</span> <span m='1977000'>of the
  cell cycle. How do, what controls all this?</span> </p><p><span m='1983000'>What
  determines when a cell is going to move around the cell cycle?</span> </p><p><span
  m='1989000'>In our bodies we have roughly three times ten to the thirteenth cells.</span>
  </p><p><span m='1995000'>I don't know if that's a number I mentioned to you before.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2001000'>It's a pretty interesting number. It's probably not the
  most</span> <span m='2007000'>interesting number. By now far more people are</span>
  <span m='2012000'>interested in the number of how many games the Red Sox have won
  or lost,</span> <span m='2016000'>but it's a number anyhow. How many cell divisions
  do we go through in a</span> <span m='2021000'>lifetime? Did we ever talk about
  that? How many times do we have a</span> <span m='2026000'>cell growth and division
  cycle in a human lifetime,</span> <span m='2030000'>lifetime? And the answer is
  in human lifetime there are about ten</span> <span m='2035000'>to the sixth cell
  divisions. It's a staggering number.</span> </p><p><span m='2040000'>Ten to the
  sixteenth in one human body in a human lifetime.</span> </p><p><span m='2043000'>And
  if you figure out what that amounts to, I think it's something</span> <span m='2047000'>like,
  and you can figure it out yourself, I think it amounts to</span> <span m='2051000'>something
  like ten to the seventh cell divisions in each second.</span> </p><p><span m='2055000'>So,
  each time I'm talking with you I'm going, I've already gone through</span> <span
  m='2058000'>any one of my sentences. And by the time my longwinded</span> <span
  m='2062000'>sentence is finished, I've probably already had 100</span> <span m='2066000'>million
  mitoses happening inside of me. That's --</span> <span m='2070000'>Maybe even more
  because some of my sentences are really long.</span> </p><p><span m='2073000'>So,
  imagine that, ten to the seventh for a second.</span> </p><p><span m='2077000'>You
  can figure out the number. This is a lifetime of let's say you</span> <span m='2080000'>live
  70 years, you can do the math of how many it</span> <span m='2084000'>is per second.
  A lot of that's going on,</span> <span m='2088000'>by the way, in the bone marrow
  and in the gut, because in the bone</span> <span m='2091000'>marrow you're constantly
  replacing a lot of your red blood cells.</span> </p><p><span m='2095000'>You have
  lots of them, but they only last for 120 days.</span> </p><p><span m='2099000'>So,
  after 120 days a red blood cell is broken down and you get a new red</span> <span
  m='2102000'>blood cell in its place. But obviously you have more than</span> <span
  m='2106000'>one blood cell in your body. The same thing happens in the gut.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2110000'>The cells lining the gut, those are called epithelial cells,</span>
  <span m='2114000'>they're lining the surface of the gut, and they are constantly
  being</span> <span m='2118000'>sloughed off the wall of the gut. Why? Because it's
  not so nice to</span> <span m='2122000'>live on the wall of the gut. It's not a
  very pleasant</span> <span m='2126000'>environment. And the cells are therefore</span>
  <span m='2129000'>constantly gotten, gotten rid of because they have a</span> <span
  m='2133000'>hard time surviving for extended periods of time.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2137000'>Those cells live only three or four days on the wall of the gut.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2141000'>So, when you go to the bathroom, I don't mean to be too
  graphic, but</span> <span m='2144000'>number two, a significant proportion of what
  comes out the bottom is</span> <span m='2148000'>actually cells that have been sloughed
  off from the epithelial</span> <span m='2152000'>lining of the gut. I don't know
  what the proportion is.</span> </p><p><span m='2156000'>It's something like 20%
  or 30%. About half of what comes out is</span> <span m='2160000'>actually bacterial
  in the, in the feces. We're not having</span> <span m='2164000'>lunch now so you
  can, you can absorb all this,</span> <span m='2168000'>right? About half of it.
  Almost none of the bulk of the</span> <span m='2172000'>feces actually ends up being
  what you ate because most of what you ate</span> <span m='2176000'>ended up, ends
  up getting compressed to a very small amount of solid</span> <span m='2180000'>matter.
  So, most of what comes out is, is not what,</span> <span m='2184000'>what came in,
  is not the processing of food but other things,</span> <span m='2188000'>as I've
  just mentioned. And, by the way,</span> <span m='2192000'>here's another unsettling
  statistic. It's not so graphic but it's</span> <span m='2197000'>unsettling if you
  think about it. There are more bacterial cells in</span> <span m='2202000'>your
  gut than in the rest, than there are mammalian eukaryotic</span> <span m='2206000'>cells
  in the rest of your body. They're taking over. There are</span> <span m='2211000'>more
  of them than there are us in each one of our bodies.</span> </p><p><span m='2216000'>Go
  figure. Anyhow. Why am I going on this long</span> <span m='2221000'>excursion?
  Well, only he knows and he's not telling.</span> </p><p><span m='2225000'>But there
  was a reason behind it. The reason why I'm going into this</span> <span m='2229000'>is
  to impress on you the fact that it's really important that the</span> <span m='2233000'>advance
  of cells through their growth and division cycle that we've</span> <span m='2237000'>just
  talked about here is very carefully controlled,</span> <span m='2241000'>because
  each one of these growth, cell growth and division cycles is</span> <span m='2245000'>the
  opportunity for disaster. What kind of disaster?</span> </p><p><span m='2250000'>Well,
  if the cell makes a mistake in its chromosomes it might die.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2253000'>The death of a cell in our body is not a disaster.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2257000'>I just indicated to you that we're, we're making ten to the seventh
  new</span> <span m='2260000'>cells every second, but hopefully we're making exactly</span>
  <span m='2264000'>the same number of cells that die. So, ten to the seventh cells
  are</span> <span m='2268000'>made for every ten to the seventh cells that die.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2271000'>If you have an excess of new cells compared with dying
  cells you're in</span> <span m='2275000'>bad shape because that's really the disease
  of cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='2279000'>And that implies, even with our knowing
  any,</span> <span m='2282000'>without our knowing anything else about cancer, that
  there have to be</span> <span m='2285000'>very careful controls over the decision
  on the part of a cell to</span> <span m='2289000'>whether, as to whether it can
  grow or divide, as to whether or not it</span> <span m='2292000'>should grow and
  divide. Now, what does that mean?</span> </p><p><span m='2296000'>Well, part of
  the decisions come from the following situation.</span> </p><p><span m='2299000'>Let's
  imagine here we're growing, we're talking about a human tissue.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2302000'>Each one of these things is a cell. And, as usual, my art is not that</span>
  <span m='2306000'>splendid. But one of the things I want to</span> <span m='2310000'>impress
  on you is that the body cannot give license to this cell or</span> <span m='2314000'>to
  this cell or to this cell to make the decision about growing and</span> <span m='2318000'>dividing
  on its own. A cell cannot go and say I think I</span> <span m='2322000'>feel like
  dividing, I'm going to go do it.</span> </p><p><span m='2326000'>That's a no-no.
  Why is it a no-no? Because the moment one grants</span> <span m='2330000'>autonomy
  to such a cell one's in a very dangerous situation.</span> </p><p><span m='2334000'>Instead,
  what has to happen, what must happen is that cells talk</span> <span m='2338000'>to
  one another and cells read a consensus.</span> </p><p><span m='2343000'>For instance,
  maybe there's a cell that's missing right over here in</span> <span m='2346000'>this
  tissue. And keep in mind an architecturally complex tissue has a</span> <span m='2350000'>precise
  number of cells in it organized in a very precise pattern.</span> </p><p><span m='2353000'>And
  the way that pattern is maintained is that the cells are</span> <span m='2357000'>constantly
  looking around and seeing is there a gap here?</span> </p><p><span m='2361000'>Do
  we need to make a new cell or not? It's not as if this cell says,</span> <span m='2364000'>well,
  I'm happy here and all my neighbors are happy but,</span> <span m='2368000'>still,
  I'm going to grow and divide because it seems like</span> <span m='2372000'>a nice
  thing to do. Again, that's an invitation for</span> <span m='2376000'>disaster.
  And I'm saying that if only to impress upon you the fact</span> <span m='2380000'>that
  cells only will make the decision to grow and divide and to</span> <span m='2384000'>go
  into this cell cycle on the basis of consultations with their</span> <span m='2388000'>neighbors.
  They're constantly talking to one another.</span> </p><p><span m='2392000'>The signals,
  the intercellular signals within a living tissue</span> <span m='2396000'>represent
  constant ceaseless chatter.</span> </p><p><span m='2400000'>It's like everybody
  is on a cell phone talking with six or eight or</span> <span m='2403000'>ten of
  his or her neighbors all the time. And if you could hear it,</span> <span m='2407000'>it
  would be a real din. So, that raised the question how do cells</span> <span m='2411000'>talk
  with one another? What messages do they exchange,</span> <span m='2415000'>one with
  the other, so that they can establish some kind of consensus as</span> <span m='2418000'>to
  whether or not it's inappropriate for one of their number to grow and</span> <span
  m='2422000'>divide? All right. This is an unauthorized ad.</span> </p><p><span m='2426000'>You
  can interpret it the way you want.</span> </p><p><span m='2430000'>Anyhow. So how
  do they do that? Well, what they do, one of the most</span> <span m='2434000'>important
  ways they communicate is they exchange proteins with one</span> <span m='2438000'>another
  called growth factors. And a growth factor goes from one</span> <span m='2442000'>cell,
  here's a cell, it releases a growth factor and it</span> <span m='2446000'>goes
  to a second cell and induces the second cell to begin to divide.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2451000'>That's a mechanism of transferring the signal or conveying the signal.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2455000'>And a growth factor itself is a relatively low molecular
  weight</span> <span m='2459000'>protein which travels through interstellular,</span>
  <span m='2463000'>interstellar, intercellular space. It moves from one cell to the
  other.</span> </p><p><span m='2468000'>So, it's secreted by one cell, it moves here,
  and then it goes over</span> <span m='2472000'>here to a second cell. In fact, if
  we want to blow up the</span> <span m='2476000'>second cell, the second cell has
  on its surface a specific protein which</span> <span m='2480000'>is known as a receptor
  or, in this case, we can say a growth</span> <span m='2485000'>factor receptor,
  which represents a means by which</span> <span m='2489000'>that cell senses the
  presence of a growth factor in the extracellular</span> <span m='2493000'>space.
  And, as is suggested in this very</span> <span m='2498000'>crude and poorly drawn
  cartoon, this receptor is a transmembrane</span> <span m='2503000'>protein. It has
  an extra cellular domain, it has an intracellular</span> <span m='2508000'>domain,
  and it moves through, it protrudes through the lipid</span> <span m='2514000'>bilayer
  of the plasma membrane. We talked very briefly about these</span> <span m='2519000'>at
  the beginning of the semester. And what happens is these receptors</span> <span
  m='2524000'>are so configured that in the event that a growth factor comes over
  and</span> <span m='2528000'>is sent off by a neighboring cell, the growth factor,
  I'll draw it here</span> <span m='2533000'>as a, as a square, this growth factor
  binds to the</span> <span m='2538000'>receptor in a very specific fashion. And,
  as a consequence, the receptor</span> <span m='2542000'>responds in its intracellular
  or cytoplasmic domain by emitting</span> <span m='2547000'>signals into the cell
  informing the cell that an encounter has been had</span> <span m='2551000'>in the
  extracellular space with this growth factor which has been</span> <span m='2556000'>released
  ostensibly by another cell.</span> </p><p><span m='2561000'>Now, the fact of the
  matter is there are many different kinds of growth</span> <span m='2565000'>factors.
  Here I've drawn, drawn, drawn a square one. Here's a</span> <span m='2569000'>triangular
  one. Here's a circular one.</span> </p><p><span m='2573000'>And each one of these
  growth factors has its own cognate receptor.</span> </p><p><span m='2577000'>So,
  here's a receptor that binds circular growth factors.</span> </p><p><span m='2582000'>Here's
  a receptor that binds triangular growth factors.</span> </p><p><span m='2586000'>Well,
  obviously I'm very schematic. The point I wish to make is that</span> <span m='2590000'>there
  are multiple distinct kinds of receptors, and each growth factor we</span> <span
  m='2594000'>can, I'll abbreviate it as a, as a GF, each growth factor is</span>
  <span m='2599000'>what's called a ligand, or a ligand depending on where you</span>
  <span m='2603000'>live, a ligand for the receptor. So, in this case the square thing</span>
  <span m='2607000'>is the ligand for the receptor. It binds to the receptor and,</span>
  <span m='2612000'>in so doing, it provokes the receptor to emit a signal which his</span>
  <span m='2616000'>transferred in through the plasma membrane into the cell cytoplasm.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2620000'>Clearly, what I also wish to indicate by this is that growth</span>
  <span m='2624000'>factors don't bind to inappropriate receptors. They only bind
  to their</span> <span m='2629000'>appropriate receptors or their cognate receptors.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2633000'>So, for example, there's a growth factor that we'll talk</span>
  <span m='2637000'>about shortly. It's called epidermal</span> <span m='2640000'>growth
  factor.</span> </p><p><span m='2644000'>And I'll just abbreviate GF for growth factor.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2647000'>There's another growth factor that called platelet-derived</span>
  <span m='2650000'>growth factor.</span> </p><p><span m='2656000'>So, we have EGF,
  we have PDGF, platelet-derived</span> <span m='2660000'>growth factor. And, in fact,
  there's actually 30</span> <span m='2664000'>or 40 other kinds of growth factors.
  And each one binds specifically to</span> <span m='2668000'>its own receptors. And
  so now we begin to understand</span> <span m='2672000'>that the signaling channels
  are actually very multiplexed.</span> </p><p><span m='2676000'>It's not just at
  one, one kind of growth factor can travel through</span> <span m='2680000'>intercellular
  space. And, again, this cell will only</span> <span m='2684000'>receive, will only
  make a decision to grow and divide if its growth</span> <span m='2688000'>factor
  receptors have send an adequate number of stimulatory</span> <span m='2692000'>signals
  into the cell which then pursued the signaling circuitry</span> <span m='2696000'>which
  processes these signals that it is indeed time to make the binary</span> <span m='2700000'>decision,
  growth versus non-growth on the basis of these signals</span> <span m='2704000'>received
  from the extracellular space.</span> </p><p><span m='2709000'>From that we can already
  intuit something interesting about cancer</span> <span m='2713000'>cells. Cancer
  cells make a decision to grow even without having received</span> <span m='2718000'>the
  signal from their neighbors. In other words, cancer cells become</span> <span m='2722000'>quasi
  or totally, they become growth factor</span> <span m='2727000'>independent. That
  is to say somehow they have</span> <span m='2732000'>usurped and perturbed this
  signaling mechanism and they have no longer</span> <span m='2737000'>become dependent
  on these extracellular signals in order to</span> <span m='2741000'>make the decision
  to grow and divide. They will just grow in essentially</span> <span m='2746000'>an
  autonomous or independent fashion. And we know a little bit about this</span> <span
  m='2751000'>from the following kind of experiment.</span> </p><p><span m='2756000'>If
  you put a human connective tissue cell, a connective tissue cell is</span> <span
  m='2760000'>called a fibroblast in culture or even a mouse, fibroblast in culture,</span>
  <span m='2765000'>you put it in a Petri dish like this, it'll sit on the bottom.</span>
  </p><p><span m='2769000'>You can provide this fibroblast or fibroblasts with all
  the nutrients</span> <span m='2774000'>it needs, with glucose and with vitamins
  and vital amino,</span> <span m='2778000'>essential amino acids, whatever you want,
  give it all those low</span> <span m='2783000'>molecular weight compounds and the,
  and the fibroblasts will sit down on</span> <span m='2787000'>the dish. And it will
  look up at you and smile.</span> </p><p><span m='2792000'>And it will do so for
  days and weeks. It won't do anything.</span> </p><p><span m='2797000'>It won't grow
  at all. Why? Because you haven't given it the</span> <span m='2802000'>requisite
  signals to induce it, to persuade it, to proliferate. And</span> <span m='2806000'>what
  are those requisite signals? They are growth factors. So, you</span> <span m='2811000'>need
  to add growth factors in addition to the nutrients in order</span> <span m='2816000'>to
  persuade a cell to emerge from its quiescent state into the active</span> <span
  m='2821000'>growth and division cycle. And so in my last minutes or my last</span>
  <span m='2827000'>minute, hopefully not on this earth but in this lecture,</span>
  <span m='2833000'>let me just say that when you, I mean nothing is sure, but if
  you</span> <span m='2839000'>take a cell and you deprive it, you starve it of growth
  factors it</span> <span m='2845000'>exits from the active growth and division cycle
  and it will go out</span> <span m='2851000'>into another phase called G zero. And
  it will sit there like a bump on</span> <span m='2856000'>a log for an extended
  period of time. It will be metabolically active,</span> <span m='2860000'>viable,
  but it won't proliferate. It will be like the cells you put in</span> <span m='2865000'>the
  Petri dish without growth factors. And if you give it growth</span> <span m='2870000'>factors
  then the cell will go back into the G1 phase of the cell cycle</span> <span m='2874000'>and
  begin active growth cycling. It will pass through a successive</span> <span m='2879000'>cycles
  of growth and division as long as you give it growth factors.</span> </p><p><span
  m='2884000'>And each time the cell emerges from M it's going to ask the question,</span>
  <span m='2888000'>are there any growth factors around me? If so, I might commit
  myself to</span> <span m='2893000'>doing this over again. And if there aren't, I'm
  getting</span> <span m='2897000'>out of this racetrack and going over to G zero
  where I may stay for days,</span> <span m='2902000'>weeks or years. On that dramatic
  and tense note, see</span> <span m='2906000'>you on Wednesday.</span> </p>
