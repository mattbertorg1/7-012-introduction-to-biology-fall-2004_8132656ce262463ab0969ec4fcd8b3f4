transcript: "<p><span m='1000'>Among the issues that some people asked that should\
  \ be discussed in</span> <span m='4000'>greater detail should be the structure of\
  \ proteins.</span> </p><p><span m='8000'>I'll touch on it very briefly this morning,\
  \ different kinds of bonding,</span> <span m='12000'>tertiary and quaternary structure,\
  \ condensation or dehydration</span> <span m='17000'>reactions. And, in fact, many\
  \ of those issues should</span> <span m='21000'>be addressed in the recitation sections.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='26000'>That's the ideal place to begin to clarify things which\
  \ although they</span> <span m='30000'>were mentioned here may not have been mentioned\
  \ in the degree of</span> <span m='34000'>detail that you really need to assimilate\
  \ them properly.</span> </p><p><span m='38000'>And I urge you to raise these issues\
  \ with the recitation section</span> <span m='42000'>instructors. That's exactly\
  \ what they're there for.</span> </p><p><span m='46000'>Having said that I just\
  \ want to dip back briefly into protein structure,</span> <span m='50000'>even though\
  \ we turned our back on it at the end of last time,</span> <span m='54000'>just\
  \ to reinforce some things that I realized I should have mentioned</span> <span\
  \ m='58000'>perhaps in greater detail. Here for the example are different</span>\
  \ <span m='61000'>ways of depicting the three-dimensional structure of the</span>\
  \ <span m='65000'>protein. And, by the way, we see that these are</span> <span m='68000'>beta\
  \ pleated sheets in the light brown and these are alpha helices.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='71000'>There are two of them here in green, one going this way,</span> <span\
  \ m='75000'>the other going this way, a third one going this way.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='78000'>And the other blue areas are not structured, i.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='82000'>., they're not structured in the sense that they are in any way</span>\
  \ <span m='85000'>obviously alpha helices or beta pleated sheets.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='89000'>Here's a space-filling model, a space-filling depiction of a</span>\
  \ <span m='92000'>protein. We talked about that last time. Here is a trace of the</span>\
  \ <span m='96000'>backbone, of the peptide backbone of the same protein where the\
  \ side</span> <span m='100000'>chains are left out, and obviously where one is only</span>\
  \ <span m='104000'>plotting the three-dimensional coordinates of each of the backbone</span>\
  \ <span m='107000'>atoms, CCN, CCN, CCN. Here is yet another way of</span> <span\
  \ m='111000'>plotting exactly the same protein in terms of indicating,</span> <span\
  \ m='115000'>as we just said, the structure of these alpha helices in</span> <span\
  \ m='119000'>the other regions. That is the secondary structure of</span> <span\
  \ m='123000'>this protein. And here's yet a fourth way of plotting,</span> <span\
  \ m='127000'>of depicting the same structure of the protein where roughly one is</span>\
  \ <span m='131000'>depicting the configuration of the amino acids in terms of a\
  \ large</span> <span m='136000'>sausage. Excuse me. If one were to use a space-filling</span>\
  \ <span m='140000'>model we'd go up to here. So these are just four ways of</span>\
  \ <span m='144000'>looking at the same protein with different degrees of simplification.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='149000'>Another point that I thought I would like to reinforce\
  \ and make was the</span> <span m='153000'>following. We've talked about transmembrane\
  \ proteins in the past.</span> </p><p><span m='157000'>That is, proteins which protrude\
  \ through a membrane from one side to</span> <span m='161000'>the other. And a point\
  \ that I realized I'd like to make is that if</span> <span m='166000'>we look at\
  \ a transmembrane protein here's one that is starting out in</span> <span m='170000'>the\
  \ cytoplasm of a cell. And, by the way, the soluble part</span> <span m='174000'>of\
  \ the cytoplasm is sometimes called the cytosol.</span> </p><p><span m='179000'>Here\
  \ is the lipid bilayer that we talked about at length and here is</span> <span m='183000'>the\
  \ extracellular domain of this same protein. Now,</span> <span m='187000'>how is\
  \ all this organized? Well, the fact of the matter is we</span> <span m='191000'>discussed\
  \ the fact that this hydrophobic space in the lipid</span> <span m='195000'>bilayer\
  \ is so hydrophobic that it really doesn't like to be in the</span> <span m='199000'>presence\
  \ of hydrophilic molecules, including in this case amino acids.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='203000'>And what we see here is the fact that almost all of the amino acids</span>\
  \ <span m='207000'>in this region of the protein, which is called the transmembrane</span>\
  \ <span m='211000'>region of the protein because it reaches from one side to the\
  \ other,</span> <span m='215000'>are all hydrophobic or neutral amino acids which\
  \ are reasonably</span> <span m='219000'>comfortable in the hydrophobic space of\
  \ the lipid bilayer.</span> </p><p><span m='223000'>There happens to be two apparent\
  \ violators of this,</span> <span m='227000'>glutamine and histidine. You see these\
  \ two here? I mean</span> <span m='231000'>glutamic acid and histidine. Glutamic\
  \ acid and histidine.</span> </p><p><span m='235000'>One is negatively charged and\
  \ therefore is highly hydrophilic.</span> </p><p><span m='239000'>The other is positively\
  \ charged and is therefore highly hydrophilic.</span> </p><p><span m='243000'>And\
  \ on the surface that would seem to violate the rule I just</span> <span m='247000'>articulated.\
  \ But the fact is that as it turns out in the particular</span> <span m='251000'>protein\
  \ these two charges, these two amino acids are so closely</span> <span m='255000'>juxtaposed\
  \ with one another that their positive and negative charges</span> <span m='259000'>are\
  \ used to neutralize one another. And as a consequence in effect</span> <span m='263000'>there\
  \ is no strong charging or polarity in this area</span> <span m='267000'>or in this\
  \ area. The take-home lesson is that somehow</span> <span m='272000'>proteins manage\
  \ to insert themselves and to remain stable in the lipid</span> <span m='276000'>bilayer\
  \ by virtue of either using only stretches of hydrophobic or</span> <span m='281000'>nonpolar\
  \ amino acids or they use tricks like this of neutralizing any</span> <span m='285000'>charges\
  \ that happen to be there. Note, by the way, that because</span> <span m='290000'>there\
  \ are hydrophilic amino acids down here and there turn out to be</span> <span m='295000'>hydrophilic\
  \ amino acid around here, arginine, and here there's a whole</span> <span m='299000'>bunch\
  \ of basic amino acids. Note that this keeps the</span> <span m='303000'>transmembrane\
  \ protein from getting pulled in one direction or the other</span> <span m='307000'>because\
  \ this arginine likes to associate with the negative</span> <span m='310000'>phosphates\
  \ on the outside of the phospholipids.</span> </p><p><span m='314000'>And the same\
  \ thing is here. And all that means is that this</span> <span m='318000'>transmembrane\
  \ protein is firmly anchored in the lipid bilayer,</span> <span m='321000'>a point\
  \ we'll talk about later in greater detail when we talk about</span> <span m='325000'>membrane\
  \ structure. One other little point I'll mention</span> <span m='329000'>here in\
  \ passing, which we'll also get into in greater</span> <span m='333000'>detail,\
  \ is that once a protein has been polymerized that polymerization</span> <span m='338000'>is\
  \ not the last thing that happens to it once it's polymerized and</span> <span m='342000'>folded\
  \ into place because we know that proteins undergo what is called</span> <span m='346000'>post-translational\
  \ modifications. And, as we'll talk about in the</span> <span m='351000'>coming\
  \ weeks, the process of synthesizing a protein</span> <span m='355000'>is called\
  \ translation. And when we talk about</span> <span m='360000'>post-translational\
  \ modification what we're talking about is opening our</span> <span m='364000'>eyes\
  \ to the possibility that even after the primary amino acid</span> <span m='368000'>sequence\
  \ has been polymerized there are chemical alterations that can</span> <span m='373000'>subsequently\
  \ be imposed on the amino acid side chains to further modify</span> <span m='377000'>the\
  \ protein. One such modification, by example, is a proteolytic</span> <span m='382000'>degradation.\
  \ And when I talk about proteolytic degradation,</span> <span m='386000'>I'm talking\
  \ about the fact that one can break down a protein.</span> </p><p><span m='391000'>Proteolysis\
  \ is the breaking down of a protein. And when we talk about</span> <span m='395000'>degradation\
  \ we're talking about destroying what has been synthesized.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='399000'>In the case of many proteins, once they're synthesized there may</span>\
  \ <span m='404000'>be a stretch of amino acids at one end or the other that simply\
  \ clipped</span> <span m='408000'>off therefore creating a protein which is smaller\
  \ than the initially</span> <span m='413000'>synthesized product of protein synthesis,\
  \ i.e.</span> </p><p><span m='417000'>the initially synthesized product of translation.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='422000'>Here we see yet another kind of post-translational modification,</span>\
  \ <span m='427000'>because it turns out that in many proteins which protrude into\
  \ the</span> <span m='432000'>extracellular space there is yet another kind of covalent</span>\
  \ <span m='438000'>modification which is the process of glycosylation in which a\
  \ series of</span> <span m='443000'>sugar side chains, carbohydrate side chains\
  \ is</span> <span m='448000'>covalently attached to the polypeptide chain usually\
  \ on serines</span> <span m='454000'>or threonines using the hydroxyl of the side\
  \ chain of serines or</span> <span m='459000'>threonines to attach these oligosaccharide\
  \ side chains.</span> </p><p><span m='465000'>We know from our discussion the last\
  \ time oligosaccharide means an</span> <span m='469000'>assembly of a small number\
  \ of monosaccharides.</span> </p><p><span m='473000'>And each of these blue hexagons\
  \ represents a monosaccharide which</span> <span m='478000'>are covalently linked\
  \ and also modify the extracellular domain of</span> <span m='482000'>this protein\
  \ as it protrudes into the extracellular space.</span> </p><p><span m='487000'>So\
  \ I'm just opening our eyes to the possibility that in the future we're</span> <span\
  \ m='491000'>going to talk about yet other ways in which proteins are modified to</span>\
  \ <span m='495000'>further tune-up their structure to make them more suitable,</span>\
  \ <span m='500000'>more competent to do the various jobs to which they've been assigned.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='504000'>Let's therefore return to what we talked about the last\
  \ time,</span> <span m='509000'>the fact that the structure of nucleic acids is\
  \ based on</span> <span m='513000'>this simple principle. Here, by the way,</span>\
  \ <span m='518000'>I'm returning to the notion of this numbering system.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='522000'>We're talking about a pentose nucleic acid. The fact that\
  \ there</span> <span m='526000'>are two hydroxyls here right away tells us that\
  \ we're looking at a</span> <span m='530000'>ribose rather than a deoxyribose which,\
  \ as I said last time,</span> <span m='534000'>lacks this sugar right there. Note,\
  \ as we've said repeatedly,</span> <span m='538000'>that the hydroxyl side chains\
  \ of carbohydrates offer numerous</span> <span m='543000'>opportunities for using\
  \ dehydration reactions, or as they're sometimes</span> <span m='549000'>called\
  \ condensation reactions where you remove a water,</span> <span m='554000'>where\
  \ you take out a water, dehydration, or we can call them</span> <span m='559000'>condensation\
  \ reactions to attach yet other things. And,</span> <span m='565000'>in fact, in\
  \ principle there are actually four different hydroxyls</span> <span m='570000'>that\
  \ could be used here to do that. There's one here,</span> <span m='575000'>there's\
  \ one here, one here and one here. There are four different</span> <span m='579000'>hydroxyls.\
  \ The 1, the 2, the 3 and the 5 hydroxyl are,</span> <span m='584000'>in principle,\
  \ opportunities for further modification.</span> </p><p><span m='588000'>In truth\
  \ the 2-prime hydroxyl is rarely used, as we'll discuss</span> <span m='593000'>shortly,\
  \ but the main actors are therefore this hydroxyl here in</span> <span m='597000'>which\
  \ a condensation reaction has created a glycosidic bond.</span> </p><p><span m='602000'>That\
  \ is a bond between a sugar and a non-sugar entity.</span> </p><p><span m='606000'>Glyco\
  \ refers obviously to sugars like glycogen or glycosylation we've</span> <span m='611000'>talked\
  \ about before. Here a bond has been made between a</span> <span m='615000'>base,\
  \ and we'll talk about the different bases shortly,</span> <span m='620000'>and\
  \ the 1-prime hydroxyl of the ribose. Over here at the 5-prime</span> <span m='625000'>hydroxyl\
  \ yet another condensation reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='630000'>Sometimes this\
  \ is called an esterification reaction.</span> </p><p><span m='634000'>And again\
  \ esterification refers to these kinds of condensation</span> <span m='639000'>reactions\
  \ where an acid and a base react with one another,</span> <span m='644000'>and once\
  \ again through a condensation reaction,</span> <span m='648000'>yield the removal\
  \ of a water. And let's look at what's happening</span> <span m='653000'>here, because\
  \ not only is one phosphate group attached to the</span> <span m='658000'>5-prime\
  \ carbon, to the 5-prime hydroxyl.</span> </p><p><span m='663000'>In fact, there\
  \ are three. And they are located, and each of</span> <span m='667000'>them has\
  \ a name. The inboard one is called alpha,</span> <span m='671000'>moving further\
  \ out is beta, and furthest out is gamma.</span> </p><p><span m='675000'>And it\
  \ turns out that this chain of phosphates have very important</span> <span m='679000'>implications\
  \ for energy metabolism and for biosynthesis.</span> </p><p><span m='683000'>Why?\
  \ I'm glad I asked that question. Because these are all</span> <span m='687000'>three\
  \ highly negatively charged. This is negatively charged,</span> <span m='691000'>this\
  \ is and this is. And, as you know, negative charges repel one</span> <span m='695000'>another.\
  \ And as a consequence, to create a triphosphate linkage</span> <span m='699000'>like\
  \ this represents pushing together negative charged moieties,</span> <span m='703000'>these\
  \ three phosphates, even though they don't like to be next to one</span> <span m='707000'>another.\
  \ And that pushing together, that creation of the triphosphate</span> <span m='711000'>chain\
  \ represents an investment of energy. And once the three are</span> <span m='715000'>pushed\
  \ together that represents great potential energy much like a</span> <span m='719000'>spring\
  \ that has been compressed together and would just</span> <span m='723000'>love\
  \ to pop apart. These three phosphates would love to</span> <span m='727000'>pop\
  \ apart from one another by virtue of the fact that these negative</span> <span\
  \ m='731000'>charges are mutually repelling. But they cannot as long as they're</span>\
  \ <span m='736000'>in this triphosphate configuration. But once the triphosphate</span>\
  \ <span m='740000'>configuration is broken then the energy released by their leaving\
  \ one</span> <span m='745000'>another can then be exploited for yet other purposes.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='750000'>Keep in mind, just to reinforce what I said a second ago,</span>\
  \ <span m='754000'>the difference between a ribose and a deoxyribose is the presence\
  \ or the</span> <span m='758000'>absence of this oxygen. And now let's focus in\
  \ a little</span> <span m='762000'>more detail on the bases because the bases are\
  \ indeed the subject of much</span> <span m='766000'>of our discussion today. And\
  \ we have two basic kinds of</span> <span m='770000'>bases. They're called nitrogenous\
  \ bases, these bases,</span> <span m='774000'>because they have nitrogen in them.\
  \ And if you look at the five bases</span> <span m='779000'>that are depicted here\
  \ you'll see that they are not aromatic rings</span> <span m='783000'>with just\
  \ carbons in them like a six carbon benzene.</span> </p><p><span m='788000'>Rather\
  \ all of them have a substantial fraction of nitrogens</span> <span m='792000'>actually\
  \ in the ring, two in the case of these pyrimidines.</span> </p><p><span m='796000'>And\
  \ here you see the number actually is four.</span> </p><p><span m='801000'>In fact,\
  \ one of these nitrogenous bases indicated here,</span> <span m='805000'>guanine\
  \ has actually a fifth one up here as a side chain.</span> </p><p><span m='810000'>This\
  \ is outside of the chain, it represents a side group. And if</span> <span m='814000'>we\
  \ begin now to make distinctions between the ring itself and the</span> <span m='818000'>entities\
  \ that protrude out of the ring, they really represent some of</span> <span m='822000'>the\
  \ important distinguishing characteristics.</span> </p><p><span m='826000'>It's\
  \ important that we understand that pyrimidines have one ring and</span> <span m='830000'>these\
  \ have two rings in them. The purines have a five and a six</span> <span m='834000'>membered\
  \ ring fused together, as you can see. The pyrimidines</span> <span m='838000'>have\
  \ only a six membered ring. And what's really important in</span> <span m='842000'>determining\
  \ their identity is not the basic pyrimidine or purine</span> <span m='846000'>structure.\
  \ It's once again the side chains that distinguish these one</span> <span m='850000'>from\
  \ the other. Here in the case of cytosine we see</span> <span m='854000'>that there's\
  \ a carbonyl here, an oxygen sticking out, and there's</span> <span m='858000'>an\
  \ amine over here. We see uracil which happens to be</span> <span m='862000'>present\
  \ in RNA but not DNA which has two carbonyls here and here.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='866000'>Obviously, therefore what distinguishes these two from one</span> <span\
  \ m='870000'>another is this oxygen versus this amine.</span> </p><p><span m='874000'>And\
  \ here we see the thymine which is present in DNA but not RNA.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='877000'>And this will become very familiar to you shortly.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='881000'>This looks just like uracil except for the fact that there's a methyl</span>\
  \ <span m='884000'>group sticking out here. Now, very important for our</span> <span\
  \ m='888000'>understanding of what's happening here is the fact that this methyl</span>\
  \ <span m='891000'>group, although it distinguishes thymine from uracil is itself</span>\
  \ <span m='895000'>biologically actually very important.</span> </p><p><span m='899000'>It's\
  \ there to be sure and it's a distinguishing mark of T versus U,</span> <span m='903000'>but\
  \ the business end of T versus U in terms of encoding information</span> <span m='907000'>happens\
  \ here with these two oxygens sticking out. They're the important</span> <span m='911000'>oxygens,\
  \ here and here. And therefore from the point of</span> <span m='915000'>view of\
  \ information content, as we'll soon see, T and U are</span> <span m='920000'>essentially\
  \ equivalent. It may be that one of them happens</span> <span m='924000'>to be in\
  \ RNA and the other in DNA, but from the point of view of</span> <span m='928000'>understanding\
  \ the coding information they carry it's these two carbonyls</span> <span m='932000'>here\
  \ and here which dictate essentially their identity.</span> </p><p><span m='937000'>We\
  \ have the same kind of dynamics that operate here in the case of A</span> <span\
  \ m='941000'>and G where once again this one has only an amine side chain and this</span>\
  \ <span m='945000'>one has a carbonyl and an amine side chain right here.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='949000'>Now, very important there is a confusing array of names\
  \ that are</span> <span m='953000'>associated with all this. I don't know if it\
  \ you can,</span> <span m='957000'>well, it reads reasonably well. Because once\
  \ a base,</span> <span m='961000'>and I just showed you bases which are unattached\
  \ to the sugars,</span> <span m='965000'>once bases are attached to the sugars they\
  \ change their name</span> <span m='970000'>slightly. So keep in mind that here,\
  \ when we talk about these nitrogenous</span> <span m='974000'>bases, the bases\
  \ are just free molecules where in each case this</span> <span m='978000'>lowest\
  \ nitrogen is the one that participates in the formation of a</span> <span m='983000'>covalent\
  \ glycosidic bond with the ribose or the deoxyribose</span> <span m='987000'>underneath\
  \ it. And here we can see one indication</span> <span m='992000'>of how that, you\
  \ see this N, in all cases via a condensation</span> <span m='997000'>reaction,\
  \ forms a covalent bond with a five carbon sugar,</span> <span m='1002000'>once\
  \ again deoxyribose or ribose. Once the base associates with the</span> <span m='1007000'>sugar,\
  \ that is the base plus the sugar is called a nucleoside.</span> </p><p><span m='1012000'>So\
  \ when we talk in polite company about a nucleoside we're not talking</span> <span\
  \ m='1017000'>about free bases. We're talking about the covalent</span> <span m='1022000'>interaction\
  \ of a pentose binding to a base. The pentose could be one or</span> <span m='1028000'>the\
  \ other of these two. And that's what a nucleoside is.</span> </p><p><span m='1033000'>If\
  \ on top of that we add additionally one or more phosphates</span> <span m='1039000'>then\
  \ we even modify our language even further because a base attached</span> <span\
  \ m='1044000'>to a sugar which in turn is attached to a phosphate is called</span>\
  \ <span m='1050000'>a nucleotide. The nucleotide,</span> <span m='1054000'>the T\
  \ is there to designate the fact that there's actually,</span> <span m='1058000'>in\
  \ addition to the base and the sugar there's a phosphate which is</span> <span m='1062000'>attached\
  \ and extends off the end. And there are slightly different</span> <span m='1066000'>names.\
  \ For the purposes of this course we won't get into this very</span> <span m='1070000'>arcane\
  \ nomenclature because it is, to be frank, and you know I always</span> <span m='1074000'>am\
  \ frank with you, confusing. Here is U.</span> </p><p><span m='1078000'>And when\
  \ uracil, the base becomes linked to a ribose</span> <span m='1082000'>it changes\
  \ its name from uracil to uridine. Cytosine changes its name</span> <span m='1087000'>to\
  \ cytidine when it becomes a nucleoside by a covalent linkage to</span> <span m='1092000'>either\
  \ ribose or deoxyribose. Thymine becomes thymidine. And the</span> <span m='1097000'>same\
  \ nomenclature exists, the shift in their names exists in</span> <span m='1101000'>the\
  \ case of the purines as well, adenine becomes adenosine and so</span> <span m='1106000'>forth.\
  \ We need to focus mostly on the</span> <span m='1111000'>notion of A, C, T, G and\
  \ U. Those are the things we</span> <span m='1115000'>need to think about. And why\
  \ is this nomenclature</span> <span m='1119000'>confusing? Well, here the nucleoside\
  \ ends with osine,</span> <span m='1123000'>O-S-I-N-E. You see that here? You say\
  \ that's easy to remember,</span> <span m='1128000'>but look up here. Here the base\
  \ ends with O-S-I-N-E.</span> </p><p><span m='1132000'>And so this nomenclature\
  \ which was cobbled together in the early 20th</span> <span m='1136000'>century\
  \ will bedevil us and generations of biology students to</span> <span m='1140000'>come.\
  \ Oh well, that's life. Now, one of the things we're</span> <span m='1145000'>interested\
  \ in and which I talked about briefly last time was the</span> <span m='1149000'>whole\
  \ notion of polymerization, i.e., how we actually polymerize a</span> <span m='1154000'>chain.\
  \ Let's look at this illustration which I think is more</span> <span m='1158000'>useful.\
  \ Recall the fact that I emphasized with great seriousness</span> <span m='1163000'>the\
  \ fact that nucleic acid synthesis always occurs in a certain polarity.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1167000'>It goes in a certain direction. You cannot add nucleotides on one</span>\
  \ <span m='1172000'>end or the other end willy-nilly. You can only add them onto\
  \ the</span> <span m='1176000'>3-prime end. And keep in mind that the reason why\
  \ this is defined as</span> <span m='1181000'>the 5-prime end is that this is, the\
  \ last hydroxyl sticking out at</span> <span m='1185000'>this end comes out of the\
  \ 5-prime carbon right here,</span> <span m='1189000'>the 5-prime hydroxyl. And\
  \ conversely at this end we're</span> <span m='1194000'>adding another base at the\
  \ 3-prime hydroxyl, at this end,</span> <span m='1198000'>which creates the 3-prime\
  \ end of the DNA or the RNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1203000'>In fact, the polymerization\
  \ always occurs between the 5-prime end of a</span> <span m='1208000'>deoxyribonucleotide\
  \ indicated here where the bases remain anonymous and</span> <span m='1213000'>the\
  \ 3-prime hydroxyl. That's the way it always happens.</span> </p><p><span m='1218000'>And\
  \ here we begin to appreciate the role of the high energy</span> <span m='1224000'>phosphate\
  \ linkage. Because this high energy</span> <span m='1229000'>triphosphate linkage,\
  \ which is synthesized elsewhere in</span> <span m='1234000'>the cell like a coiled\
  \ spring and which contains a lot of potential</span> <span m='1239000'>energy by\
  \ virtue of this mutual negative repulsion of the phosphate</span> <span m='1243000'>groups,\
  \ this energy is used to form the bond here between the phosphate</span> <span m='1248000'>in\
  \ this condensation reaction and the 3-prime hydroxyl.</span> </p><p><span m='1253000'>So\
  \ that requires an investment of energy. And the resulting linkage</span> <span\
  \ m='1258000'>which is formed is sometimes called a phosphodiester linkage.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1263000'>Why phosphodiester? Well, obviously it's phospho.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1266000'>And there actually are two esterifications that are occurring</span>\
  \ <span m='1270000'>here. If we look at one of these phosphodiester bonds we see\
  \ that an</span> <span m='1274000'>ester linkage has been made with this hydroxyl\
  \ and an ester linkage</span> <span m='1277000'>has been made with this hydroxyl.\
  \ And for that reason it's called a</span> <span m='1281000'>phosphodiester linkage.\
  \ Therefore we come to realize that</span> <span m='1285000'>polymerization of nucleic\
  \ acids doesn't take place spontaneously.</span> </p><p><span m='1289000'>It requires\
  \ the investment of a high-energy molecule,</span> <span m='1293000'>the investment\
  \ of the energy that it carries. And when this linkage is</span> <span m='1298000'>formed\
  \ the diphosphate here, the beta and the gamma phosphates</span> <span m='1302000'>float\
  \ off into interstellar space. It's only the alpha phosphate that</span> <span m='1307000'>is\
  \ retained to form the resulting diphosphate, a phosphodiester</span> <span m='1312000'>linkage.\
  \ And this process can be repeated literally thousands and</span> <span m='1316000'>millions\
  \ of times. An average human's chromosomes</span> <span m='1321000'>contains on\
  \ the order of tens, fifty, a hundred mega-bases of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1326000'>A\
  \ mega-base is a million bases or a million nucleotides.</span> </p><p><span m='1330000'>So\
  \ there you can understand that there's no limit to the extent of</span> <span m='1334000'>elongation\
  \ of these various kinds of molecules. Now,</span> <span m='1338000'>note by the\
  \ way yet another feature of this which is that the</span> <span m='1342000'>distinguishing\
  \ feature between DNA and RNA, the most important</span> <span m='1346000'>distinguishing\
  \ feature is this 2-prime hydroxyl.</span> </p><p><span m='1350000'>And here we're\
  \ talking about DNA, but we could almost in the same</span> <span m='1354000'>breath\
  \ be talking about the way that RNA gets polymerized.</span> </p><p><span m='1358000'>Why?\
  \ Because this 2-prime hydroxyl or this 2-prime hydrogen in this</span> <span m='1362000'>case\
  \ is out of the line of fire. The business action is happening</span> <span m='1366000'>right\
  \ along here. Look where the business action is</span> <span m='1370000'>in terms\
  \ of the backbone. The 2-prime hydroxyl is off to the</span> <span m='1374000'>side.\
  \ And whether it's oxygen or just whether it's OH,</span> <span m='1378000'>that\
  \ is in ribose, a hydroxyl group or just a hydrogen,</span> <span m='1382000'>as\
  \ is indicated here in the case of deoxyribose, is irrelevant</span> <span m='1386000'>to\
  \ the polymerization. And therefore we can guess or intuit,</span> <span m='1390000'>and\
  \ just because we guessed doesn't mean it's wrong,</span> <span m='1394000'>often\
  \ it's right, it doesn't really make much</span> <span m='1398000'>difference whether\
  \ we look at DNA or RNA. Here's a polymerization scheme</span> <span m='1402000'>of\
  \ RNA and it's absolutely identical to that of DNA.</span> </p><p><span m='1406000'>In\
  \ this case it's ribonucleotide triphosphates that are used for the</span> <span\
  \ m='1410000'>polymerization reaction. Now here I just uttered the phrase</span>\
  \ <span m='1415000'>ribonucleoside triphosphates. Why did I say that? Well,</span>\
  \ <span m='1421000'>ultimately only the good Lord knows why I said that.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1427000'>But let's look at this phrase. I said ribonucleoside\
  \ triphosphate</span> <span m='1433000'>rather than ribonucleotide triphosphate\
  \ because the fact that I</span> <span m='1439000'>added this on the end makes the\
  \ T there unnecessary.</span> </p><p><span m='1445000'>The T is there to indicate\
  \ the phosphate being attached to the</span> <span m='1449000'>ribose or the deoxyribose.\
  \ But if I'm adding this phrase over</span> <span m='1453000'>here, triphosphate,\
  \ that obviates, that makes</span> <span m='1457000'>unnecessary my saying ribonucleotide\
  \ triphosphate. If I'm looking at UTP</span> <span m='1461000'>or ATP, I would say\
  \ I'm a ribonucleotide if I don't mention</span> <span m='1465000'>the triphosphate.\
  \ But the moment this comes from my</span> <span m='1469000'>lips then we'll say\
  \ ribonucleoside indicating that a ribonucleoside,</span> <span m='1473000'>that\
  \ is a base and a sugar are then attached to one or more</span> <span m='1477000'>phosphate\
  \ linkages. Now, the ultimate basis of the</span> <span m='1481000'>biological revolution\
  \ comes from the realization that these different</span> <span m='1485000'>bases\
  \ have complementarity to one another. That is they like to be</span> <span m='1490000'>together\
  \ with one another. And if we look at this and we think</span> <span m='1494000'>about\
  \ the DNA double helix we come to realize that these bases have</span> <span m='1498000'>affinities\
  \ for one another. And the general affinity is one</span> <span m='1503000'>purine\
  \ likes to be facing opposite one pyrimidine.</span> </p><p><span m='1507000'>One\
  \ pyrimidine opposite one purine. And if we have two pyrimidines</span> <span m='1512000'>facing\
  \ one another they're not close enough to one another to kiss.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1516000'>And if we have two purines they're too close to one another,</span>\
  \ <span m='1521000'>they're bumping into one another, they take up too much space.\
  \ And</span> <span m='1525000'>therefore the optimal configuration is one purine\
  \ and one pyrimidine.</span> </p><p><span m='1530000'>And you can see these two\
  \ pairings here in the case of what happens</span> <span m='1534000'>with DNA. In\
  \ fact, the realization of this diagram</span> <span m='1539000'>right here is what\
  \ triggered the discovery of DNA in 1953.</span> </p><p><span m='1544000'>This diagram\
  \ right here is what triggered the biological revolution.</span> </p><p><span m='1549000'>And\
  \ though it's been depicted in many, many ways it's worthwhile</span> <span m='1553000'>dwelling\
  \ on it because this is perhaps the most important diagram</span> <span m='1558000'>that\
  \ we'll address all semester. Although this doesn't mean we have</span> <span m='1562000'>to\
  \ spend all semester assimilating it. It's not so complicated.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1566000'>It's relatively straightforward. And let's look at its features.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1570000'>Let's dwell on them momentarily because this is a microscopic</span>\
  \ <span m='1574000'>snapshot of what DNA is composed of. You all know it's a double\
  \ helix</span> <span m='1577000'>and therefore there are two strands of DNA in a\
  \ double helix.</span> </p><p><span m='1581000'>And one of the interesting things\
  \ about the double helix,</span> <span m='1585000'>although we're not showing it\
  \ yet, we're just showing a little section</span> <span m='1589000'>of a double\
  \ helix, is the polarity of the two chains</span> <span m='1593000'>that constitute\
  \ the double helix. Let's look at that polarity.</span> </p><p><span m='1596000'>This\
  \ one is running in one direction and this one,</span> <span m='1600000'>the opposite\
  \ one, the complementary one is running in the other</span> <span m='1604000'>direction.\
  \ And therefore we talk about the double helix as being</span> <span m='1607000'>anti-parallel.\
  \ Well, I guess I should have a</span> <span m='1611000'>bandage on the other finger\
  \ to convince you but you get the idea.</span> </p><p><span m='1615000'>They're\
  \ running in opposite directions.</span> </p><p><span m='1619000'>They're not both\
  \ pointed the same. And the other thing to indicate is,</span> <span m='1623000'>to\
  \ repeat what I said just seconds ago, that there's a complementarity</span> <span\
  \ m='1628000'>between the purines and the pyrimidines. So we use the word</span>\
  \ <span m='1633000'>complementary with great frequency, with great promiscuity in\
  \ biology.</span> </p><p><span m='1638000'>Complementarity refers to the fact that\
  \ A and T here or A and U because</span> <span m='1642000'>I said U and T are functionally\
  \ equivalent, they like to</span> <span m='1647000'>be opposite one another. There's\
  \ a purine and a pyrimidine.</span> </p><p><span m='1652000'>And the converse is\
  \ the case with C and G, they like to be opposite one</span> <span m='1656000'>another.\
  \ Now, there is specificity here.</span> </p><p><span m='1660000'>You might say\
  \ any purine can pair up with any pyrimidine,</span> <span m='1664000'>but it's\
  \ not the case. For instance, A doesn't like to be opposite C and</span> <span m='1668000'>T\
  \ doesn't like to be opposite G. So one of the things we have to</span> <span m='1672000'>memorize\
  \ this semester, and it's not many and it's not hard,</span> <span m='1676000'>is\
  \ that A and T are opposite one another, or A and U,</span> <span m='1680000'>and\
  \ G and C are opposite one another. That's one of the essential concepts</span>\
  \ <span m='1684000'>in molecular biology. There are now a thousand things you</span>\
  \ <span m='1688000'>need to learn, but if you don't understand that</span> <span\
  \ m='1691000'>then ultimately sooner or later you'll find yourself in a swamp,</span>\
  \ <span m='1694000'>literally or figuratively. Now, let's look at the different\
  \ between</span> <span m='1698000'>these two. One of the interesting things is,\
  \ to state the obvious,</span> <span m='1701000'>the way they're associating with\
  \ one another, hand in glove,</span> <span m='1704000'>is via hydrogen bonds. That's\
  \ not any covalent interaction,</span> <span m='1708000'>which means they're reversible.\
  \ We talked about that.</span> </p><p><span m='1711000'>Which means that if we were\
  \ to take a solution of double stranded DNA</span> <span m='1715000'>and boil it\
  \ we would break those hydrogen bonds.</span> </p><p><span m='1719000'>Remember\
  \ they only have 8 kilocalories per mole and boiling</span> <span m='1723000'>water\
  \ has far higher energetic content. And consequently if we</span> <span m='1727000'>heat\
  \ up a DNA double helix and we break those double bonds of DNA that</span> <span\
  \ m='1731000'>hold the two strands together, the two strands come apart, the DNA</span>\
  \ <span m='1735000'>ends up being denatured, that is the two strands are</span>\
  \ <span m='1739000'>separated one from the other. In fact, if there ever were a</span>\
  \ <span m='1743000'>covalent cross-link between the two strands that's really bad\
  \ news for a</span> <span m='1747000'>cell carrying such a DNA double helix. A covalently\
  \ cross-link from</span> <span m='1751000'>one strand to the other DNA double helix\
  \ represents often a sign that a</span> <span m='1755000'>cell should go off and\
  \ die because it has a very hard time dealing with</span> <span m='1759000'>that\
  \ by virtue of the fact, as we will soon learn or as you</span> <span m='1763000'>already\
  \ know, the cell has, with some frequency, to pull apart</span> <span m='1767000'>these\
  \ two strands. And therefore this association must</span> <span m='1771000'>be tight\
  \ enough so that it's stable at body temperature but not so tight</span> <span m='1775000'>that\
  \ it cannot be pulled apart when certain biological conditions call</span> <span\
  \ m='1779000'>for it. You see that in fact here there are three hydrogen bonds and</span>\
  \ <span m='1783000'>here there are only two hydrogen bonds. That also has its</span>\
  \ <span m='1787000'>implications. It turns out to be the case that the disposition\
  \ of</span> <span m='1791000'>this hydrogen and this oxygen here, they're far enough\
  \ apart that for</span> <span m='1795000'>all practical purposes they don't really\
  \ make very good</span> <span m='1799000'>hydrogen bonds. And therefore we think\
  \ of this as</span> <span m='1803000'>having two and this having three. And if you\
  \ were to try to put C</span> <span m='1807000'>opposite A or G opposite T you'd\
  \ see that they cannot form hydrogen bonds</span> <span m='1812000'>well with one\
  \ another. Instead they kind of bump into one</span> <span m='1816000'>another,\
  \ and therefore are not complementary to one another at all.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1820000'>There's another corollary that we can deduce from this diagram,</span>\
  \ <span m='1825000'>and that is the following. If it's always true that A equal</span>\
  \ <span m='1829000'>C and G equal T --</span> <span m='1836000'>A equals T and G\
  \ equals C. By the way, this is an interesting</span> <span m='1840000'>story. This\
  \ is the Chargaff Rule. Because about a year or so before</span> <span m='1845000'>Watson\
  \ and Crick figured out the structure of the double helix there</span> <span m='1849000'>was\
  \ a guy named Erwin Chargaff in New York at Columbia University who</span> <span\
  \ m='1854000'>one day figured out that if you looked at a whole bunch of nucleic</span>\
  \ <span m='1858000'>acids, different DNAs from different cell types --</span> <span\
  \ m='1863000'>And in certain cell types what he found was that G was equal to,</span>\
  \ <span m='1869000'>for example G equals 20% of the bases. Therefore,</span> <span\
  \ m='1876000'>obviously we know C must equal also 20% because there always has to\
  \ be a</span> <span m='1883000'>C opposite a G in the double helix, right? G and\
  \ C always have to be</span> <span m='1889000'>equal. And Chargaff discovered that,\
  \ in fact, A in such DNA always was</span> <span m='1896000'>30% and T was also\
  \ 30%. Well, these together make up 100%</span> <span m='1903000'>which is, we're\
  \ not in higher math yet, but A and T were always the</span> <span m='1909000'>same.\
  \ If you looked at another type of DNA he might find that G equals</span> <span\
  \ m='1915000'>23% and C also equals 23%. And in this same DNA then A would</span>\
  \ <span m='1920000'>equal 27%, I guess, and T also equals 27%.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='1925000'>And I hope that adds up to 100%. So he looked at a whole bunch of</span>\
  \ <span m='1930000'>DNAs and they always tracked one another, A always tracked T,</span>\
  \ <span m='1935000'>G always tracked C. And then in 1953 up comes these two guys\
  \ from</span> <span m='1941000'>Cambridge, England, Watson and Crick whom Chargaff</span>\
  \ <span m='1946000'>regarded as upstarts, as smart-asses who thought they knew</span>\
  \ <span m='1951000'>all the answers. And Watson and Crick said,</span> <span m='1955000'>gee,\
  \ this Chargaff rule really is very interesting because it suggests</span> <span\
  \ m='1959000'>something about the structure of DNA. These cannot just be coincidences.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='1962000'>There's something profoundly important they said,</span>\
  \ <span m='1966000'>correctly, in the fact that there was always an equivalence\
  \ between A</span> <span m='1970000'>and T and between G and C. And that represented\
  \ one of the</span> <span m='1973000'>conceptual cornerstones of their elucidating\
  \ the structure</span> <span m='1977000'>of the double helix. And so Chargaff who\
  \ died last year</span> <span m='1981000'>or the year before last, at an advanced\
  \ age, was for the next</span> <span m='1985000'>fifty years a very bitter man,\
  \ because he was this far away from</span> <span m='1989000'>figuring out this far.\
  \ Not this far, but this far away</span> <span m='1993000'>from figuring out, making\
  \ the most important discovery</span> <span m='1997000'>in biology in the 20th century.\
  \ He had the information right there.</span> </p><p><span m='2002000'>And if he\
  \ thought a little bit about information theory and thought</span> <span m='2006000'>a\
  \ little bit about the way information content is encoded he</span> <span m='2010000'>could\
  \ have already predicted, not the detailed structure of the</span> <span m='2014000'>double\
  \ helix, but at least the way in which it encodes information.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2019000'>Because, to state the obvious, and as many of you know already,</span>\
  \ <span m='2022000'>if one looks at the structure of a double helix one can,</span>\
  \ <span m='2026000'>in principle, depict it in a two or a three-dimensional cartoon.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2030000'>Here's the way one can think of it. This is the way we've\
  \ been talking</span> <span m='2034000'>about it over the last couple of minutes.\
  \ It's a two-dimensional</span> <span m='2038000'>double helix. And from the point\
  \ of view of</span> <span m='2042000'>information encoding, it doesn't really matter\
  \ whether we</span> <span m='2046000'>draw it this way or that way. It happens that\
  \ the double helix is</span> <span m='2050000'>turned around like that, it's twisted\
  \ around. It's very</span> <span m='2054000'>difficult for biological molecules\
  \ to be totally flat for an extended</span> <span m='2058000'>period. And the helix\
  \ is, in fact, something that is</span> <span m='2062000'>frequently resorted to.\
  \ Witness the alpha helix in the</span> <span m='2066000'>protein. So these are\
  \ turned around. It turns out that each of these</span> <span m='2070000'>constitutes\
  \ a base pair, and each of these base pairs is,</span> <span m='2074000'>in fact,\
  \ 3.4 angstroms apart. 3.4 angstroms thick.</span> </p><p><span m='2079000'>So you\
  \ have ten of them, the DNA helix advances 3.4 angstroms</span> <span m='2084000'>every\
  \ ten turns. And ten turns is roughly,</span> <span m='2089000'>oh, I'm sorry. Ten\
  \ base pairs is roughly one turn of the alpha helix.</span> </p><p><span m='2094000'>So\
  \ if you go here and you count up ten, we should start again at the</span> <span\
  \ m='2099000'>same orientation. Another ten is another turn.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2104000'>Another ten is another turn. In fact, I'm just recalling that I</span>\
  \ <span m='2109000'>was once a TA in 7. 1 in 1965. And there was a physics</span>\
  \ <span m='2115000'>professor who became a biologist who always talked about these\
  \ double</span> <span m='2120000'>helices. And he always talked about the measurements\
  \ of different DNA</span> <span m='2125000'>molecules. Now, you may know that the\
  \ term angstrom</span> <span m='2130000'>is named after a Danish person named Angstrom.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2136000'>That's why it got its name. So whenever this professor,</span>\
  \ <span m='2140000'>whom I never corrected, God forbid, ever talked about something\
  \ that was</span> <span m='2145000'>ten angstroms long, he called these ten angstra.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2150000'>Now, as you know, when you go in a Latin verb from singular\
  \ to plural</span> <span m='2154000'>it's \x93-um\x94 to \x93-a\x94, right? So he\
  \ pretended this was a</span> <span m='2159000'>Latin word. What's a good word?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2164000'>Sorry? What's a common Latin word we use? Sorry?</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2168000'>Millennium. Yeah, millennium, millennia.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2172000'>So he went from angstrom to anstra. And it went on for a whole year.\
  \ I</span> <span m='2176000'>never said anything but I knew better. OK, anyhow.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2180000'>Here you see the genius of Watson and Crick. And,</span>\
  \ <span m='2184000'>by the way, Angstrom was a Dane, as I said, and not a Roman\
  \ soldier.</span> </p><p><span m='2188000'>So here we see. OK. So here is the genius\
  \ of their</span> <span m='2192000'>discovery. And the elegance of it is not how\
  \ complicated it is.</span> </p><p><span m='2196000'>The elegance of it is how simple\
  \ it is, because information we see is</span> <span m='2201000'>encoded in two strands.\
  \ The information is redundant</span> <span m='2206000'>because if we know the sequence\
  \ of one strand we can obviously predict</span> <span m='2210000'>the sequence in\
  \ the other strand because it's a complementary</span> <span m='2215000'>sequence.\
  \ If we always realize that A is</span> <span m='2220000'>opposite T and G is opposite\
  \ C we can know directly that a sequence in</span> <span m='2225000'>one strand,\
  \ which may be A, C, T, G, G, C and the other strand</span> <span m='2230000'>moving\
  \ in the other anti-parallel direction the sequence is like this.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2236000'>I don't need to know the sequence of the other strand.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2241000'>I can predict it by using these rules of complementary</span> <span\
  \ m='2246000'>sequence structure. And that, in turn,</span> <span m='2251000'>obviously\
  \ has important implications. If we look at the three-dimensional</span> <span m='2255000'>structure,\
  \ this is more of what's called a space-filing model.</span> </p><p><span m='2259000'>This\
  \ is the way the x-ray crystallographer would actually</span> <span m='2264000'>depict\
  \ it. We talked about space-filling models before.</span> </p><p><span m='2268000'>One\
  \ of the things we appreciate is the fact that the phosphates are on</span> <span\
  \ m='2273000'>the outside and these bases are in the inside. And because these bases</span>\
  \ <span m='2277000'>are able also to stack with one another via hydrophobic interactions</span>\
  \ <span m='2281000'>importantly the bases are protected. The face where they interact\
  \ is</span> <span m='2285000'>protected from the outside world. What do I mean by\
  \ that? Well,</span> <span m='2289000'>let's go back to this figure right here.\
  \ You see the interaction faces</span> <span m='2293000'>between A and T or C and\
  \ G they're not on the outside of the helix.</span> </p><p><span m='2296000'>They're\
  \ hidden in the middle. And that's important because it means</span> <span m='2300000'>that\
  \ these interactions between A and C and G and T,</span> <span m='2303000'>you can\
  \ see it up here as well, are biochemically protected from any</span> <span m='2307000'>accidents\
  \ that might happen on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='2311000'>They're sheltered\
  \ from that. And that's important because the</span> <span m='2315000'>information\
  \ content in DNA must be held very stable,</span> <span m='2319000'>very constant.\
  \ If it isn't then we have real trouble like cancer.</span> </p><p><span m='2323000'>And\
  \ therefore whenever a cell divides and copies its DNA,</span> <span m='2327000'>its\
  \ three billion base pairs of DNA, whenever that happens the number of</span> <span\
  \ m='2331000'>mistakes that are made is only three or four or five out three billion.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2335000'>A stunningly low rate. And this DNA can sit around.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2340000'>I told you about Neanderthal DNA that can sit around\
  \ for 30,</span> <span m='2344000'>00 years and it's chemically relatively stable.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2348000'>In part, a testimonial to the fact that this base pairing,</span>\
  \ <span m='2352000'>the face where the two bases interact across one another,</span>\
  \ <span m='2356000'>this is shielded from the outside world because it's tucked\
  \ into the</span> <span m='2360000'>middle, these interaction faces here. This is\
  \ the inside of the helix.</span> </p><p><span m='2364000'>Here the sugar phosphate\
  \ groups are on the outside.</span> </p><p><span m='2369000'>In fact, when Watson\
  \ and Crick were struggling with the structure of the</span> <span m='2373000'>double\
  \ helix they were in a horse race with a man named Linus Pauling</span> <span m='2377000'>who\
  \ was really the inventor, the discoverer of the hydrogen bond</span> <span m='2381000'>pretty\
  \ much who actually got two Nobel Prizes in his lifetime who</span> <span m='2385000'>ended\
  \ his life believing that if you took enough vitamin C grams of it</span> <span\
  \ m='2389000'>every day you would never get sick. I don't know what he died of,\
  \ but</span> <span m='2393000'>probably like Dr. Atkins he probably died of an</span>\
  \ <span m='2397000'>illness he was trying to ward off. Or he might have died of\
  \ kidney</span> <span m='2402000'>failure from all the vitamin C he was putting\
  \ into his body.</span> </p><p><span m='2406000'>Who knows? Anyhow, I digress. The\
  \ fact is that Pauling thought</span> <span m='2410000'>that, in fact, DNA was constituted\
  \ of a triple</span> <span m='2414000'>helix, with three strands, and that the bases\
  \ were facing</span> <span m='2418000'>outward. Well, of course, now we can snicker,</span>\
  \ <span m='2422000'>now we can laugh, but at the time nobody had any idea.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2426000'>Now we realize it's only a double helix and the bases</span>\
  \ <span m='2430000'>are facing inward. And, of course,</span> <span m='2433000'>because\
  \ Pauling worked with that preconception,</span> <span m='2437000'>he was never\
  \ able to figure what was actually going on,</span> <span m='2441000'>even though\
  \ Watson and Crick thought that he had the answer and was about</span> <span m='2445000'>to\
  \ scoop them. Implicit in what I've just said is</span> <span m='2449000'>the notion\
  \ that the structure of DNA, which we'll talk about later,</span> <span m='2453000'>allows\
  \ it to be copied, i.e., now we're referring in passing,</span> <span m='2457000'>and\
  \ we'll get into this in greater detail later, to the whole</span> <span m='2461000'>process\
  \ of replication. Because if we have genetic material</span> <span m='2465000'>and\
  \ we've created in a certain sequence we must be able to make</span> <span m='2469000'>more\
  \ copies of it. Keep in mind that each one of us,</span> <span m='2473000'>as I\
  \ mentioned to you some lectures ago, we start out with a fertilized</span> <span\
  \ m='2478000'>egg with one human genome, and through our lifetimes we produce</span>\
  \ <span m='2482000'>how many cells? Anybody remember?</span> </p><p><span m='2486000'>I\
  \ did mention it, right? Is there one soul who remembers it?</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2491000'>Remember the whole story of Sodom and Gomorrah where the Lord says\
  \ if</span> <span m='2496000'>there's one soul, one righteous soul in the city I</span>\
  \ <span m='2501000'>will spare the city. And of course there wasn't so he</span>\
  \ <span m='2506000'>wiped them all out. 30 trillion? Well,</span> <span m='2512000'>sorry.\
  \ What do we do for him? Something nice. [APPLAUSE]</span> <span m='2517000'>Excellent.\
  \ OK. You'll remain anonymous,</span> <span m='2522000'>though. You won't be on\
  \ that video. OK. Ten to the sixteenth cell</span> <span m='2526000'>divisions in\
  \ a human lifetime. And on every one of those occasions</span> <span m='2530000'>the\
  \ double helix is copied. I'm telling you that only to give</span> <span m='2534000'>you\
  \ the most dramatic demonstration of the fact that if you have one set</span> <span\
  \ m='2538000'>of DNA molecules you need to be able to copy it, you need to be able\
  \ to</span> <span m='2542000'>replicate it. And that replicative ability is inherent\
  \ in the double</span> <span m='2546000'>helix as Watson and Crick immediately said\
  \ and as they noted</span> <span m='2550000'>at the end of their paper when -- I\
  \ think the last sentence says it</span> <span m='2553000'>has not escaped our attention\
  \ that this structure,</span> <span m='2557000'>i.e., the structure of the double\
  \ helix, allows for copying,</span> <span m='2561000'>allows for replication. Because\
  \ if you pull the two strands apart,</span> <span m='2564000'>recall we said earlier\
  \ that in certain biological situations you</span> <span m='2568000'>need to do\
  \ that, if the two strands are pulled apart</span> <span m='2571000'>not by putting\
  \ them in boiling water but by enzymes whose dedicated</span> <span m='2575000'>function\
  \ it is to separate the two strands.</span> </p><p><span m='2579000'>Then when that\
  \ happens one can begin to create two new daughter double</span> <span m='2584000'>helices\
  \ by simply adding on new bases and thereby replicating the</span> <span m='2590000'>DNA.\
  \ And how that happens is, of course, as you know, IO</span> <span m='2596000'>\"\
  Intuitively Obvious\". OK. Uh-oh, we're in a dyslexic</span> <span m='2602000'>moment.\
  \ Now, the fact is I emphasized with great vigor</span> <span m='2608000'>and conviction\
  \ -- And remember, class,</span> <span m='2613000'>when somebody is convinced of\
  \ something more often than not</span> <span m='2617000'>they're just wrong in a\
  \ loud voice. But I nevertheless emphasized with</span> <span m='2621000'>great\
  \ conviction that T and U are, from an information standpoint,</span> <span m='2625000'>functionally\
  \ equivalent. They're replaceable,</span> <span m='2629000'>interchangeable. And\
  \ therefore if we want we can</span> <span m='2633000'>make an RNA copy of a DNA\
  \ molecule by realizing that if this were DNA</span> <span m='2637000'>we could\
  \ make an RNA that was complementary to a DNA strand</span> <span m='2641000'>realizing\
  \ that when the RNA molecule was being polymerized,</span> <span m='2645000'>instead\
  \ of using T one would use U. All the other three bases are</span> <span m='2649000'>functionally\
  \ equivalent. And so we could, in principle,</span> <span m='2653000'>and indeed\
  \ it happens transiently, we could make a DNA-RNA hybrid helix</span> <span m='2657000'>where\
  \ a DNA molecule is wrapped around an RNA molecule because the</span> <span m='2661000'>two\
  \ molecules are functionally equivalent. The only difference</span> <span m='2665000'>between\
  \ the two strands would be, well, there are two differences.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2669000'>One, in the RNA strand we'd have a U instead of a T.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2673000'>And, two, in the RNA strand all the sugars would be ribose rather\
  \ than</span> <span m='2677000'>deoxyribose. Right on. OK. Good. So this structure,</span>\
  \ <span m='2681000'>the simplicity of the structure gives one enormous power in\
  \ encoding</span> <span m='2685000'>all kinds of information and replicating it.</span>\
  \ </p><p><span m='2690000'>What it means, as we'll discuss also in great detail\
  \ later,</span> <span m='2694000'>is that if we have a certain sequence of bases\
  \ in the double</span> <span m='2698000'>helix of DNA an RNA molecule could be made\
  \ to copy one of the two</span> <span m='2702000'>strands to make a complementary\
  \ copy.</span> </p><p><span m='2707000'>And that RNA molecule could then leave the\
  \ DNA double helix having</span> <span m='2711000'>lifted one of the sequences from\
  \ it and then move to another part of the</span> <span m='2715000'>cell where it\
  \ might do something interesting. And therefore to</span> <span m='2719000'>extract\
  \ information out of the double helix doesn't necessarily</span> <span m='2723000'>mean\
  \ to destroy it. If one can copy one of the two</span> <span m='2727000'>double\
  \ strands in a complementary form as an RNA molecule that may</span> <span m='2731000'>enable\
  \ the information that is encoded in the DNA to be copied</span> <span m='2735000'>without\
  \ destroying the double helix itself.</span> </p><p><span m='2739000'>Again, that\
  \ process, which we'll also talk about later,</span> <span m='2743000'>is called\
  \ the process of transcription.</span> </p><p><span m='2748000'>And so in the course\
  \ of this morning I have uttered the three</span> <span m='2752000'>words which\
  \ represent the cannon, the basic fundaments of molecular</span> <span m='2757000'>biology.\
  \ What are the three words? Replication, transcription and</span> <span m='2762000'>translation.\
  \ Transcription means when you make an RNA copy of a</span> <span m='2766000'>strand\
  \ of the DNA double helix. Let's just add a couple more</span> <span m='2771000'>footnotes\
  \ to what I've been saying just so we are on firm ground for</span> <span m='2775000'>subsequent\
  \ discussions. It turns out that often in RNA</span> <span m='2780000'>molecules\
  \ they can form intramolecular double helices.</span> </p><p><span m='2785000'>There's\
  \ no reason why you cannot make a double helix out of RNA as</span> <span m='2789000'>you\
  \ can make out of DNA. And therefore you see often in many</span> <span m='2794000'>kinds\
  \ of RNA molecules they will hydrogen bond to themselves using</span> <span m='2798000'>these\
  \ complementary sequences. And this is called a hairpin, by</span> <span m='2802000'>the\
  \ way for obvious reasons. And so many RNA molecules, most of</span> <span m='2806000'>them\
  \ in fact have these intramolecular hydrogen bonded</span> <span m='2811000'>double\
  \ helices with confers on them very specific structure.</span> </p><p><span m='2815000'>One\
  \ other aspect of the two versus three hydrogen bonds</span> <span m='2819000'>is\
  \ the following. If a double helix has many Gs and Cs</span> <span m='2824000'>then\
  \ it's going to have more hydrogen bonds holding it together</span> <span m='2829000'>than\
  \ if it has few Gs and Cs. So let's look at the Chargaff</span> <span m='2833000'>example.\
  \ Chargaff who lived for fifty years stewing in his own bile</span> <span m='2838000'>in\
  \ bitterness because he couldn't figure this out,</span> <span m='2843000'>which\
  \ is exactly what happened by the way.</span> </p><p><span m='2848000'>And so here\
  \ this has a higher G plus C content, the one on the right than</span> <span m='2852000'>this\
  \ one. This is 23% or 46% G plus C. This is 40% G plus C.</span> </p><p><span m='2856000'>If\
  \ it's 46% G plus C that means there are more hydrogen bonds</span> <span m='2860000'>holding\
  \ the two strands together. And it turns out that if you want</span> <span m='2864000'>to\
  \ denature a double helix that has high G plus C content you need to</span> <span\
  \ m='2868000'>put in more energy, you need to heat the double helix up</span> <span\
  \ m='2872000'>to a higher temperature. It's more difficult to pull the</span> <span\
  \ m='2876000'>strands apart. One other side comment on what I</span> <span m='2880000'>wanted\
  \ to say is the following. The presence or the absence of this</span> <span m='2884000'>hydroxyl\
  \ here in RNA has an important consequence for the</span> <span m='2888000'>stability\
  \ of RNA and DNA. Let's look at what happens to an</span> <span m='2892000'>RNA\
  \ chain when a hydroxyl ion, which happens to be floating around</span> <span m='2896000'>at\
  \ a low concentration, happens to attack this</span> <span m='2900000'>phosphodiester\
  \ bond. What happens is that this</span> <span m='2904000'>phosphodiester bond will\
  \ tend to cyclize. It's forming this</span> <span m='2908000'>five membered ring.\
  \ And ultimately that will resolve and</span> <span m='2912000'>break causing a\
  \ cleavage of the RNA chain. This phosphodiester bond now</span> <span m='2917000'>forming\
  \ a cyclic structure here as an intermediate representing the</span> <span m='2922000'>precursor\
  \ to the ultimately cleaved chain. That means that if you take</span> <span m='2926000'>RNA\
  \ molecules and you put them in alkali they will fall apart very</span> <span m='2931000'>quickly\
  \ for this very reason. What happens to DNA molecules when</span> <span m='2936000'>you\
  \ put them in alkali? Nothing. They're alkali resistant</span> <span m='2941000'>because\
  \ there isn't a hydroxyl there to form this five membered ring.</span> </p><p><span\
  \ m='2945000'>And therefore alkali cannot cleave apart the DNA or the DNA</span>\
  \ <span m='2949000'>phosphodiester bond. If we imagine that OH groups,</span> <span\
  \ m='2953000'>that hydroxyls, are present at a certain, albeit a certain</span>\
  \ <span m='2958000'>concentration, albeit a low concentration in</span> <span m='2962000'>neutral\
  \ water we can see that even at neutral pH with a certain</span> <span m='2966000'>frequency\
  \ RNA molecules will slowly hydrolyze.</span> </p><p><span m='2971000'>They'll certainly\
  \ be slowly broken down by the hydroxyl ions.</span> </p><p><span m='2975000'>DNA\
  \ molecules, however, will not. And that represents yet another</span> <span m='2980000'>important\
  \ biochemical reason why DNA is chemically stable and why it can</span> <span m='2985000'>carry\
  \ information over years, decades or tens of thousands of</span> <span m='2990000'>years,\
  \ because the phosphodiester linkage in DNA rather than RNA is</span> <span m='2995000'>very\
  \ stable chemically and can hold these adjacent nucleotides together,</span> <span\
  \ m='3000000'>one to the other. See you on Friday morning.</span> </p>"
